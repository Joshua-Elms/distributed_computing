1. Using eval on functions, unsafe
2. Flexible, though - no special code to handle these cases
3. Expects data separated by whitespace, in folders
4. 

Remaining Tasks
- (X) Implement word count and inverted index serially
- Add dynamic logging to each process to watch what they're doing for report
- Download a few other datasets to test
- Record runtime for MapReduce vs. serial
- Compare them in a plot (hopefully MapReduce beats serial for large enough data)
- (X) Validate the correctness of MapReduce by comparing it with serial version
- Write report that includes visualization as well as everything asked for
- Try zipping this, sending to BR200, and testing over there
