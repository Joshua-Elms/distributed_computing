for some days after that evening mr heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals yet he would not consent formally to exclude hareton and cathy he had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings choosing rather to absent himself and eating once in twenty four hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him one night after the family were in bed i heard him go downstairs and out at the front door i did not hear him re enter and in the morning i found he was still away we were in april then the weather was sweet and warm the grass as green as showers and sun could make it and the two dwarf apple trees near the southern wall in full bloom after breakfast catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the fir trees at the end of the house and she beguiled hareton who had perfectly recovered from his accident to dig and arrange her little garden which was shifted to that corner by the influence of josephs complaints i was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around and the beautiful soft blue overhead when my young lady who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border returned only half laden and informed us that mr heathcliff was coming in and he spoke to me she added with a perplexed countenance what did he say asked hareton he told me to begone as fast as i could she answered but he looked so different from his usual look that i stopped a moment to stare at him how he inquired why almost bright and cheerful no almost nothing very much excited and wild and glad she replied night walking amuses him then i remarked affecting a careless manner in reality as surprised as she was and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement for to see the master looking glad would not be an every day spectacle i framed an excuse to go in heathcliff stood at the open door he was pale and he trembled yet certainly he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes that altered the aspect of his whole face will you have some breakfast i said you must be hungry rambling about all night i wanted to discover where he had been but i did not like to ask directly no im not hungry he answered averting his head and speaking rather contemptuously as if he guessed i was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour i felt perplexed i didnt know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition i dont think it right to wander out of doors i observed instead of being in bed it is not wise at any rate this moist season i daresay youll catch a bad cold or a fever you have something the matter with you now nothing but what i can bear he replied and with the greatest pleasure provided youll leave me alone get in and dont annoy me i obeyed and in passing i noticed he breathed as fast as a cat yes i reflected to myself we shall have a fit of illness i cannot conceive what he has been doing that noon he sat down to dinner with us and received a heaped up plate from my hands as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting ive neither cold nor fever nelly he remarked in allusion to my mornings speech and im ready to do justice to the food you give me he took his knife and fork and was going to commence eating when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct he laid them on the table looked eagerly towards the window then rose and went out we saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal and earnshaw said hed go and ask why he would not dine he thought we had grieved him some way well is he coming cried catherine when her cousin returned nay he answered but hes not angry he seemed rarely pleased indeed only i made him impatient by speaking to him twice and then he bid me be off to you he wondered how i could want the company of anybody else i set his plate to keep warm on the fender and after an hour or two he re entered when the room was clear in no degree calmer the same unnatural it was unnatural appearance of joy under his black brows the same bloodless hue and his teeth visible now and then in a kind of smile his frame shivering not as one shivers with chill or weakness but as a tight stretched cord vibrates a strong thrilling rather than trembling i will ask what is the matter i thought or who should and i exclaimed have you heard any good news mr heathcliff you look uncommonly animated where should good news come from to me he said im animated with hunger and seemingly i must not eat your dinner is here i returned why wont you get it i dont want it now he muttered hastily ill wait till supper and nelly once for all let me beg you to warn hareton and the other away from me i wish to be troubled by nobody i wish to have this place to myself is there some new reason for this banishment i inquired tell me why you are so queer mr heathcliff where were you last night im not putting the question through idle curiosity but you are putting the question through very idle curiosity he interrupted with a laugh yet ill answer it last night i was on the threshold of hell to day i am within sight of my heaven i have my eyes on it hardly three feet to sever me and now youd better go youll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you if you refrain from prying having swept the hearth and wiped the table i departed more perplexed than ever he did not quit the house again that afternoon and no one intruded on his solitude till at eight oclock i deemed it proper though unsummoned to carry a candle and his supper to him he was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice but not looking out his face was turned to the interior gloom the fire had smouldered to ashes the room was filled with the damp mild air of the cloudy evening and so still that not only the murmur of the beck down gimmerton was distinguishable but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles or through the large stones which it could not cover i uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate and commenced shutting the casements one after another till i came to his must i close this i asked in order to rouse him for he would not stir the light flashed on his features as i spoke oh mr lockwood i cannot express what a terrible start i got by the momentary view those deep black eyes that smile and ghastly paleness it appeared to me not mr heathcliff but a goblin and in my terror i let the candle bend towards the wall and it left me in darkness yes close it he replied in his familiar voice there that is pure awkwardness why did you hold the candle horizontally be quick and bring another i hurried out in a foolish state of dread and said to joseph the master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire for i dared not go in myself again just then joseph rattled some fire into the shovel and went but he brought it back immediately with the supper tray in his other hand explaining that mr heathcliff was going to bed and he wanted nothing to eat till morning we heard him mount the stairs directly he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber but turned into that with the panelled bed its window as i mentioned before is wide enough for anybody to get through and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion of which he had rather we had no suspicion is he a ghoul or a vampire i mused i had read of such hideous incarnate demons and then i set myself to reflect how i had tended him in infancy and watched him grow to youth and followed him almost through his whole course and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror but where did he come from the little dark thing harboured by a good man to his bane muttered superstition as i dozed into unconsciousness and i began half dreaming to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for him and repeating my waking meditations i tracked his existence over again with grim variations at last picturing his death and funeral of which all i can remember is being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument and consulting the sexton about it and as he had no surname and we could not tell his age we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word heathcliff that came true we were if you enter the kirkyard youll read on his headstone only that and the date of his death dawn restored me to common sense i rose and went into the garden as soon as i could see to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window there were none he has stayed at home i thought and hell be all right to day i prepared breakfast for the household as was my usual custom but told hareton and catherine to get theirs ere the master came down for he lay late they preferred taking it out of doors under the trees and i set a little table to accommodate them on my re entrance i found mr heathcliff below he and joseph were conversing about some farming business he gave clear minute directions concerning the matter discussed but he spoke rapidly and turned his head continually aside and had the same excited expression even more exaggerated when joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally chose and i put a basin of coffee before him he drew it nearer and then rested his arms on the table and looked at the opposite wall as i supposed surveying one particular portion up and down with glittering restless eyes and with such eager interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute together come now i exclaimed pushing some bread against his hand eat and drink that while it is hot it has been waiting near an hour he didnt notice me and yet he smiled id rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so mr heathcliff master i cried dont for gods sake stare as if you saw an unearthly vision dont for gods sake shout so loud he replied turn round and tell me are we by ourselves of course was my answer of course we are still i involuntarily obeyed him as if i was not quite sure with a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things and leant forward to gaze more at his ease now i perceived he was not looking at the wall for when i regarded him alone it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards distance and whatever it was it communicated apparently both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes at least the anguished yet raptured expression of his countenance suggested that idea the fancied object was not fixed either his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence and even in speaking to me were never weaned away i vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread his fingers clenched before they reached it and remained on the table forgetful of their aim i sat a model of patience trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing speculation till he grew irritable and got up asking why i would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals and saying that on the next occasion i neednt wait i might set the things down and go having uttered these words he left the house slowly sauntered down the garden path and disappeared through the gate the hours crept anxiously by another evening came i did not retire to rest till late and when i did i could not sleep he returned after midnight and instead of going to bed shut himself into the room beneath i listened and tossed about and finally dressed and descended it was too irksome to lie there harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings i distinguished mr heathcliffs step restlessly measuring the floor and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration resembling a groan he muttered detached words also the only one i could catch was the name of catherine coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering and spoken as one would speak to a person present low and earnest and wrung from the depth of his soul i had not courage to walk straight into the apartment but i desired to divert him from his reverie and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire stirred it and began to scrape the cinders it drew him forth sooner than i expected he opened the door immediately and said nelly come here is it morning come in with your light it is striking four i answered you want a candle to take upstairs you might have lit one at this fire no i dont wish to go upstairs he said come in and kindle me a fire and do anything there is to do about the room i must blow the coals red first before i can carry any i replied getting a chair and the bellows he roamed to and fro meantime in a state approaching distraction his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between when day breaks ill send for green he said i wish to make some legal inquiries of him while i can bestow a thought on those matters and while i can act calmly i have not written my will yet and how to leave my property i cannot determine i wish i could annihilate it from the face of the earth i would not talk so mr heathcliff i interposed let your will be a while youll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet i never expected that your nerves would be disordered they are at present marvellously so however and almost entirely through your own fault the way youve passed these three last days might knock up a titan do take some food and some repose you need only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both your cheeks are hollow and your eyes blood shot like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep it is not my fault that i cannot eat or rest he replied i assure you it is through no settled designs ill do both as soon as i possibly can but you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within arms length of the shore i must reach it first and then ill rest well never mind mr green as to repenting of my injustices ive done no injustice and i repent of nothing im too happy and yet im not happy enough my souls bliss kills my body but does not satisfy itself happy master i cried strange happiness if you would hear me without being angry i might offer some advice that would make you happier what is that he asked give it you are aware mr heathcliff i said that from the time you were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish unchristian life and probably hardly had a bible in your hands during all that period you must have forgotten the contents of the book and you may not have space to search it now could it be hurtful to send for some one some minister of any denomination it does not matter which to explain it and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts and how unfit you will be for its heaven unless a change takes place before you die im rather obliged than angry nelly he said for you remind me of the manner in which i desire to be buried it is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening you and hareton may if you please accompany me and mind particularly to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins no minister need come nor need anything be said over me i tell you i have nearly attained my heaven and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me and supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast and died by that means and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk i said shocked at his godless indifference how would you like it they wont do that he replied if they did you must have me removed secretly and if you neglect it you shall prove practically that the dead are not annihilated as soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den and i breathed freer but in the afternoon while joseph and hareton were at their work he came into the kitchen again and with a wild look bid me come and sit in the house he wanted somebody with him i declined telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me and i had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone i believe you think me a fiend he said with his dismal laugh something too horrible to live under a decent roof then turning to catherine who was there and who drew behind me at his approach he added half sneeringly will you come chuck ill not hurt you no to you ive made myself worse than the devil well there is one who wont shrink from my company by god shes relentless oh damn it its unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear even mine he solicited the society of no one more at dusk he went into his chamber through the whole night and far into the morning we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself hareton was anxious to enter but i bid him fetch mr kenneth and he should go in and see him when he came and i requested admittance and tried to open the door i found it locked and heathcliff bid us be damned he was better and would be left alone so the doctor went away the following evening was very wet indeed it poured down till day dawn and as i took my morning walk round the house i observed the masters window swinging open and the rain driving straight in he cannot be in bed i thought those showers would drench him through he must either be up or out but ill make no more ado ill go boldly and look having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key i ran to unclose the panels for the chamber was vacant quickly pushing them aside i peeped in mr heathcliff was there laid on his back his eyes met mine so keen and fierce i started and then he seemed to smile i could not think him dead but his face and throat were washed with rain the bed clothes dripped and he was perfectly still the lattice flapping to and fro had grazed one hand that rested on the sill no blood trickled from the broken skin and when i put my fingers to it i could doubt no more he was dead and stark i hasped the window i combed his black long hair from his forehead i tried to close his eyes to extinguish if possible that frightful life like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it they would not shut they seemed to sneer at my attempts and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too taken with another fit of cowardice i cried out for joseph joseph shuffled up and made a noise but resolutely refused to meddle with him th divils harried off his soul he cried and he may hev his carcass into t bargin for aught i care ech what a wicked un he looks girning at death and the old sinner grinned in mockery i thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed but suddenly composing himself he fell on his knees and raised his hands and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights i felt stunned by the awful event and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness but poor hareton the most wronged was the only one who really suffered much he sat by the corpse all night weeping in bitter earnest he pressed its hand and kissed the sarcastic savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart though it be tough as tempered steel mr kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died i concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days fearing it might lead to trouble and then i am persuaded he did not abstain on purpose it was the consequence of his strange illness not the cause we buried him to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood as he wished earnshaw and i the sexton and six men to carry the coffin comprehended the whole attendance the six men departed when they had let it down into the grave we stayed to see it covered hareton with a streaming face dug green sods and laid them over the brown mould himself at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds and i hope its tenant sleeps as soundly but the country folks if you ask them would swear on the bible that he walks there are those who speak to having met him near the church and on the moor and even within this house idle tales youll say and so say i yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago i was going to the grange one evening a dark evening threatening thunder and just at the turn of the heights i encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him he was crying terribly and i supposed the lambs were skittish and would not be guided what is the matter my little man i asked theres heathcliff and a woman yonder under t nab he blubbered un i darnut pass em i saw nothing but neither the sheep nor he would go on so i bid him take the road lower down he probably raised the phantoms from thinking as he traversed the moors alone on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat yet still i dont like being out in the dark now and i dont like being left by myself in this grim house i cannot help it i shall be glad when they leave it and shift to the grange they are going to the grange then i said yes answered mrs dean as soon as they are married and that will be on new years day and who will live here then why joseph will take care of the house and perhaps a lad to keep him company they will live in the kitchen and the rest will be shut up for the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it i observed no mr lockwood said nelly shaking her head i believe the dead are at peace but it is not right to speak of them with levity at that moment the garden gate swung to the ramblers were returning they are afraid of nothing i grumbled watching their approach through the window together they would brave satan and all his legions as they stepped on to the door stones and halted to take a last look at the moon or more correctly at each other by her light i felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again and pressing a remembrance into the hand of mrs dean and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness i vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house door and so should have confirmed joseph in his opinion of his fellow servants gay indiscretions had he not fortunately recognised me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet my walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk when beneath its walls i perceived decay had made progress even in seven months many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass and slates jutted off here and there beyond the right line of the roof to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms i sought and soon discovered the three headstones on the slope next the moor the middle one grey and half buried in heath edgar lintons only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot heathcliffs still bare i lingered round them under that benign sky watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth
