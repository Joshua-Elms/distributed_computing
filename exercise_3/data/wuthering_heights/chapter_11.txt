while miss linton moped about the park and garden always silent and almost always in tears and her brother shut himself up among books that he never opened wearying i guessed with a continual vague expectation that catherine repenting her conduct would come of her own accord to ask pardon and seek a reconciliation and she fasted pertinaciously under the idea probably that at every meal edgar was ready to choke for her absence and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her feet i went about my household duties convinced that the grange had but one sensible soul in its walls and that lodged in my body i wasted no condolences on miss nor any expostulations on my mistress nor did i pay much attention to the sighs of my master who yearned to hear his ladys name since he might not hear her voice i determined they should come about as they pleased for me and though it was a tiresomely slow process i began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress as i thought at first mrs linton on the third day unbarred her door and having finished the water in her pitcher and decanter desired a renewed supply and a basin of gruel for she believed she was dying that i set down as a speech meant for edgars ears i believed no such thing so i kept it to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast she ate and drank eagerly and sank back on her pillow again clenching her hands and groaning oh i will die she exclaimed since no one cares anything about me i wish i had not taken that then a good while after i heard her murmur no ill not die hed be glad he does not love me at all he would never miss me did you want anything maam i inquired still preserving my external composure in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange exaggerated manner what is that apathetic being doing she demanded pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted face has he fallen into a lethargy or is he dead neither replied i if you mean mr linton hes tolerably well i think though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought he is continually among his books since he has no other society i should not have spoken so if i had known her true condition but i could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder among his books she cried confounded and i dying i on the brink of the grave my god does he know how im altered continued she staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall is that catherine linton he imagines me in a pet in play perhaps cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest nelly if it be not too late as soon as i learn how he feels ill choose between these two either to starve at once that would be no punishment unless he had a heart or to recover and leave the country are you speaking the truth about him now take care is he actually so utterly indifferent for my life why maam i answered the master has no idea of your being deranged and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger you think not cannot you tell him i will she returned persuade him speak of your own mind say you are certain i will no you forget mrs linton i suggested that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening and to morrow you will perceive its good effects if i were only sure it would kill him she interrupted id kill myself directly these three awful nights ive never closed my lids and oh ive been tormented ive been haunted nelly but i begin to fancy you dont like me how strange i thought though everybody hated and despised each other they could not avoid loving me and they have all turned to enemies in a few hours they have im positive the people here how dreary to meet death surrounded by their cold faces isabella terrified and repelled afraid to enter the room it would be so dreadful to watch catherine go and edgar standing solemnly by to see it over then offering prayers of thanks to god for restoring peace to his house and going back to his books what in the name of all that feels has he to do with books when i am dying she could not bear the notion which i had put into her head of mr lintons philosophical resignation tossing about she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness and tore the pillow with her teeth then raising herself up all burning desired that i would open the window we were in the middle of winter the wind blew strong from the north east and i objected both the expressions flitting over her face and the changes of her moods began to alarm me terribly and brought to my recollection her former illness and the doctors injunction that she should not be crossed a minute previously she was violent now supported on one arm and not noticing my refusal to obey her she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species her mind had strayed to other associations thats a turkeys she murmured to herself and this is a wild ducks and this is a pigeons ah they put pigeons feathers in the pillows no wonder i couldnt die let me take care to throw it on the floor when i lie down and here is a moor cocks and this i should know it among a thousand its a lapwings bonny bird wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor it wanted to get to its nest for the clouds had touched the swells and it felt rain coming this feather was picked up from the heath the bird was not shot we saw its nest in the winter full of little skeletons heathcliff set a trap over it and the old ones dared not come i made him promise hed never shoot a lapwing after that and he didnt yes here are more did he shoot my lapwings nelly are they red any of them let me look give over with that baby work i interrupted dragging the pillow away and turning the holes towards the mattress for she was removing its contents by handfuls lie down and shut your eyes youre wandering theres a mess the down is flying about like snow i went here and there collecting it i see in you nelly she continued dreamily an aged woman you have grey hair and bent shoulders this bed is the fairy cave under penistone crags and you are gathering elf bolts to hurt our heifers pretending while i am near that they are only locks of wool thats what youll come to fifty years hence i know you are not so now im not wandering youre mistaken or else i should believe you really were that withered hag and i should think i was under penistone crags and im conscious its night and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine like jet the black press where is that i asked you are talking in your sleep its against the wall as it always is she replied it does appear odd i see a face in it theres no press in the room and never was said i resuming my seat and looping up the curtain that i might watch her dont you see that face she inquired gazing earnestly at the mirror and say what i could i was incapable of making her comprehend it to be her own so i rose and covered it with a shawl its behind there still she pursued anxiously and it stirred who is it i hope it will not come out when you are gone oh nelly the room is haunted im afraid of being alone i took her hand in mine and bid her be composed for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass theres nobody here i insisted it was yourself mrs linton you knew it a while since myself she gasped and the clock is striking twelve its true then thats dreadful her fingers clutched the clothes and gathered them over her eyes i attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband but i was summoned back by a piercing shriek the shawl had dropped from the frame why what is the matter cried i who is coward now wake up that is the glass the mirror mrs linton and you see yourself in it and there am i too by your side trembling and bewildered she held me fast but the horror gradually passed from her countenance its paleness gave place to a glow of shame oh dear i thought i was at home she sighed i thought i was lying in my chamber at wuthering heights because im weak my brain got confused and i screamed unconsciously dont say anything but stay with me i dread sleeping my dreams appal me a sound sleep would do you good maam i answered and i hope this suffering will prevent your trying starving again oh if i were but in my own bed in the old house she went on bitterly wringing her hands and that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice do let me feel it it comes straight down the moor do let me have one breath to pacify her i held the casement ajar a few seconds a cold blast rushed through i closed it and returned to my post she lay still now her face bathed in tears exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit our fiery catherine was no better than a wailing child how long is it since i shut myself in here she asked suddenly reviving it was monday evening i replied and this is thursday night or rather friday morning at present what of the same week she exclaimed only that brief time long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill temper observed i well it seems a weary number of hours she muttered doubtfully it must be more i remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled and edgar being cruelly provoking and me running into this room desperate as soon as ever i had barred the door utter blackness overwhelmed me and i fell on the floor i couldnt explain to edgar how certain i felt of having a fit or going raging mad if he persisted in teasing me i had no command of tongue or brain and he did not guess my agony perhaps it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice before i recovered sufficiently to see and hear it began to be dawn and nelly ill tell you what i thought and what has kept recurring and recurring till i feared for my reason i thought as i lay there with my head against that table leg and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window that i was enclosed in the oak panelled bed at home and my heart ached with some great grief which just waking i could not recollect i pondered and worried myself to discover what it could be and most strangely the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank i did not recall that they had been at all i was a child my father was just buried and my misery arose from the separation that hindley had ordered between me and heathcliff i was laid alone for the first time and rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping i lifted my hand to push the panels aside it struck the table top i swept it along the carpet and then memory burst in my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair i cannot say why i felt so wildly wretched it must have been temporary derangement for there is scarcely cause but supposing at twelve years old i had been wrenched from the heights and every early association and my all in all as heathcliff was at that time and been converted at a stroke into mrs linton the lady of thrushcross grange and the wife of a stranger an exile and outcast thenceforth from what had been my world you may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where i grovelled shake your head as you will nelly you have helped to unsettle me you should have spoken to edgar indeed you should and compelled him to leave me quiet oh im burning i wish i were out of doors i wish i were a girl again half savage and hardy and free and laughing at injuries not maddening under them why am i so changed why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words im sure i should be myself were i once among the heather on those hills open the window again wide fasten it open quick why dont you move because i wont give you your death of cold i answered you wont give me a chance of life you mean she said sullenly however im not helpless yet ill open it myself and sliding from the bed before i could hinder her she crossed the room walking very uncertainly threw it back and bent out careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife i entreated and finally attempted to force her to retire but i soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine she was delirious i became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings there was no moon and everything beneath lay in misty darkness not a light gleamed from any house far or near all had been extinguished long ago and those at wuthering heights were never visible still she asserted she caught their shining look she cried eagerly thats my room with the candle in it and the trees swaying before it and the other candle is in josephs garret joseph sits up late doesnt he hes waiting till i come home that he may lock the gate well hell wait a while yet its a rough journey and a sad heart to travel it and we must pass by gimmerton kirk to go that journey weve braved its ghosts often together and dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come but heathcliff if i dare you now will you venture if you do ill keep you ill not lie there by myself they may bury me twelve feet deep and throw the church down over me but i wont rest till you are with me i never will she paused and resumed with a strange smile hes considering hed rather id come to him find a way then not through that kirkyard you are slow be content you always followed me perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity i was planning how i could reach something to wrap about her without quitting my hold of herself for i could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice when to my consternation i heard the rattle of the door handle and mr linton entered he had only then come from the library and in passing through the lobby had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity or fear to examine what it signified at that late hour oh sir i cried checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which met him and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber my poor mistress is ill and she quite masters me i cannot manage her at all pray come and persuade her to go to bed forget your anger for shes hard to guide any way but her own catherine ill he said hastening to us shut the window ellen catherine why he was silent the haggardness of mrs lintons appearance smote him speechless and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment shes been fretting here i continued and eating scarcely anything and never complaining she would admit none of us till this evening and so we couldnt inform you of her state as we were not aware of it ourselves but it is nothing i felt i uttered my explanations awkwardly the master frowned it is nothing is it ellen dean he said sternly you shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this and he took his wife in his arms and looked at her with anguish at first she gave him no glance of recognition he was invisible to her abstracted gaze the delirium was not fixed however having weaned her eyes from contemplating the outer darkness by degrees she centred her attention on him and discovered who it was that held her ah you are come are you edgar linton she said with angry animation you are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted and when you are wanted never i suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations now i see we shall but they cant keep me from my narrow home out yonder my resting place where im bound before spring is over there it is not among the lintons mind under the chapel roof but in the open air with a head stone and you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me catherine what have you done commenced the master am i nothing to you any more do you love that wretch heath hush cried mrs linton hush this moment you mention that name and i end the matter instantly by a spring from the window what you touch at present you may have but my soul will be on that hill top before you lay hands on me again i dont want you edgar im past wanting you return to your books im glad you possess a consolation for all you had in me is gone her mind wanders sir i interposed she has been talking nonsense the whole evening but let her have quiet and proper attendance and shell rally hereafter we must be cautious how we vex her i desire no further advice from you answered mr linton you knew your mistresss nature and you encouraged me to harass her and not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days it was heartless months of sickness could not cause such a change i began to defend myself thinking it too bad to be blamed for anothers wicked waywardness i knew mrs lintons nature to be headstrong and domineering cried i but i didnt know that you wished to foster her fierce temper i didnt know that to humour her i should wink at mr heathcliff i performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you and i have got a faithful servants wages well it will teach me to be careful next time next time you may gather intelligence for yourself the next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service ellen dean he replied youd rather hear nothing about it i suppose then mr linton said i heathcliff has your permission to come a courting to miss and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers on purpose to poison the mistress against you confused as catherine was her wits were alert at applying our conversation ah nelly has played traitor she exclaimed passionately nelly is my hidden enemy you witch so you do seek elf bolts to hurt us let me go and ill make her rue ill make her howl a recantation a maniacs fury kindled under her brows she struggled desperately to disengage herself from lintons arms i felt no inclination to tarry the event and resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility i quitted the chamber in passing the garden to reach the road at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall i saw something white moved irregularly evidently by another agent than the wind notwithstanding my hurry i stayed to examine it lest ever after i should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world my surprise and perplexity were great on discovering by touch more than vision miss isabellas springer fanny suspended by a handkerchief and nearly at its last gasp i quickly released the animal and lifted it into the garden i had seen it follow its mistress upstairs when she went to bed and wondered much how it could have got out there and what mischievous person had treated it so while untying the knot round the hook it seemed to me that i repeatedly caught the beat of horses feet galloping at some distance but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that i hardly gave the circumstance a thought though it was a strange sound in that place at two oclock in the morning mr kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the village as i came up the street and my account of catherine lintons malady induced him to accompany me back immediately he was a plain rough man and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before nelly dean said he i cant help fancying theres an extra cause for this what has there been to do at the grange weve odd reports up here a stout hearty lass like catherine does not fall ill for a trifle and that sort of people should not either its hard work bringing them through fevers and such things how did it begin the master will inform you i answered but you are acquainted with the earnshaws violent dispositions and mrs linton caps them all i may say this it commenced in a quarrel she was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit thats her account at least for she flew off in the height of it and locked herself up afterwards she refused to eat and now she alternately raves and remains in a half dream knowing those about her but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions mr linton will be sorry observed kenneth interrogatively sorry hell break his heart should anything happen i replied dont alarm him more than necessary well i told him to beware said my companion and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning hasnt he been intimate with mr heathcliff lately heathcliff frequently visits at the grange answered i though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy than because the master likes his company at present hes discharged from the trouble of calling owing to some presumptuous aspirations after miss linton which he manifested i hardly think hell be taken in again and does miss linton turn a cold shoulder on him was the doctors next question im not in her confidence returned i reluctant to continue the subject no shes a sly one he remarked shaking his head she keeps her own counsel but shes a real little fool i have it from good authority that last night and a pretty night it was she and heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours and he pressed her not to go in again but just mount his horse and away with him my informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that when it was to be he didnt hear but you urge mr linton to look sharp this news filled me with fresh fears i outstripped kenneth and ran most of the way back the little dog was yelping in the garden yet i spared a minute to open the gate for it but instead of going to the house door it coursed up and down snuffing the grass and would have escaped to the road had i not seized it and conveyed it in with me on ascending to isabellas room my suspicions were confirmed it was empty had i been a few hours sooner mrs lintons illness might have arrested her rash step but what could be done now there was a bare possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly i could not pursue them however and i dared not rouse the family and fill the place with confusion still less unfold the business to my master absorbed as he was in his present calamity and having no heart to spare for a second grief i saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue and suffer matters to take their course and kenneth being arrived i went with a badly composed countenance to announce him catherine lay in a troubled sleep her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy he now hung over her pillow watching every shade and every change of her painfully expressive features the doctor on examining the case for himself spoke hopefully to him of its having a favourable termination if we could only preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity to me he signified the threatening danger was not so much death as permanent alienation of intellect i did not close my eyes that night nor did mr linton indeed we never went to bed and the servants were all up long before the usual hour moving through the house with stealthy tread and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations every one was active but miss isabella and they began to remark how sound she slept her brother too asked if she had risen and seemed impatient for her presence and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister in law i trembled lest he should send me to call her but i was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight one of the maids a thoughtless girl who had been on an early errand to gimmerton came panting upstairs open mouthed and dashed into the chamber crying oh dear dear what mun we have next master master our young lady hold your noise cried i hastily enraged at her clamorous manner speak lower mary what is the matter said mr linton what ails your young lady shes gone shes gone yon heathcliffs run off wi her gasped the girl that is not true exclaimed linton rising in agitation it cannot be how has the idea entered your head ellen dean go and seek her it is incredible it cannot be as he spoke he took the servant to the door and then repeated his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion why i met on the road a lad that fetches milk here she stammered and he asked whether we werent in trouble at the grange i thought he meant for mississ sickness so i answered yes then says he theres somebody gone after em i guess i stared he saw i knew nought about it and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horses shoe fastened at a blacksmiths shop two miles out of gimmerton not very long after midnight and how the blacksmiths lass had got up to spy who they were she knew them both directly and she noticed the man heathcliff it was she felt certain nobdy could mistake him besides put a sovereign in her fathers hand for payment the lady had a cloak about her face but having desired a sup of water while she drank it fell back and she saw her very plain heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on and they set their faces from the village and went as fast as the rough roads would let them the lass said nothing to her father but she told it all over gimmerton this morning i ran and peeped for forms sake into isabellas room confirming when i returned the servants statement mr linton had resumed his seat by the bed on my re entrance he raised his eyes read the meaning of my blank aspect and dropped them without giving an order or uttering a word are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back i inquired how should we do she went of her own accord answered the master she had a right to go if she pleased trouble me no more about her hereafter she is only my sister in name not because i disown her but because she has disowned me and that was all he said on the subject he did not make a single inquiry further or mention her in any way except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home wherever it was when i knew it
