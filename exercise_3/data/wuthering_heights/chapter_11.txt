sometimes while meditating on these things in solitude ive got up in a sudden terror and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm ive persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways and then ive recollected his confirmed bad habits and hopeless of benefiting him have flinched from re entering the dismal house doubting if i could bear to be taken at my word one time i passed the old gate going out of my way on a journey to gimmerton it was about the period that my narrative has reached a bright frosty afternoon the ground bare and the road hard and dry i came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand a rough sand pillar with the letters w h cut on its north side on the east g and on the south west t g it serves as a guide post to the grange the heights and village the sun shone yellow on its grey head reminding me of summer and i cannot say why but all at once a gush of childs sensations flowed into my heart hindley and i held it a favourite spot twenty years before i gazed long at the weather worn block and stooping down perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snail shells and pebbles which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things and as fresh as reality it appeared that i beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf his dark square head bent forward and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate poor hindley i exclaimed involuntarily i started my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine it vanished in a twinkling but immediately i felt an irresistible yearning to be at the heights superstition urged me to comply with this impulse supposing he should be dead i thought or should die soon supposing it were a sign of death the nearer i got to the house the more agitated i grew and on catching sight of it i trembled in every limb the apparition had outstripped me it stood looking through the gate that was my first idea on observing an elf locked brown eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars further reflection suggested this must be hareton my hareton not altered greatly since i left him ten months since god bless thee darling i cried forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears hareton its nelly nelly thy nurse he retreated out of arms length and picked up a large flint i am come to see thy father hareton i added guessing from the action that nelly if she lived in his memory at all was not recognised as one with me he raised his missile to hurl it i commenced a soothing speech but could not stay his hand the stone struck my bonnet and then ensued from the stammering lips of the little fellow a string of curses which whether he comprehended them or not were delivered with practised emphasis and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity you may be certain this grieved more than angered me fit to cry i took an orange from my pocket and offered it to propitiate him he hesitated and then snatched it from my hold as if he fancied i only intended to tempt and disappoint him i showed another keeping it out of his reach who has taught you those fine words my bairn i inquired the curate damn the curate and thee gie me that he replied tell us where you got your lessons and you shall have it said i whos your master devil daddy was his answer and what do you learn from daddy i continued he jumped at the fruit i raised it higher what does he teach you i asked naught said he but to keep out of his gait daddy cannot bide me because i swear at him ah and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy i observed ay nay he drawled who then heathcliff i asked if he liked mr heathcliff ay he answered again desiring to have his reasons for liking him i could only gather the sentences i knownt he pays dad back what he gies to me he curses daddy for cursing me he says i mun do as i will and the curate does not teach you to read and write then i pursued no i was told the curate should have his teeth dashed down his throat if he stepped over the threshold heathcliff had promised that i put the orange in his hand and bade him tell his father that a woman called nelly dean was waiting to speak with him by the garden gate he went up the walk and entered the house but instead of hindley heathcliff appeared on the door stones and i turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever i could race making no halt till i gained the guide post and feeling as scared as if i had raised a goblin this is not much connected with miss isabellas affair except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the grange even though i should wake a domestic storm by thwarting mrs lintons pleasure the next time heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court she had never spoken a word to her sister in law for three days but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining and we found it a great comfort heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on miss linton i knew now as soon as he beheld her his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house front i was standing by the kitchen window but i drew out of sight he then stepped across the pavement to her and said something she seemed embarrassed and desirous of getting away to prevent it he laid his hand on her arm she averted her face he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer there was another rapid glance at the house and supposing himself unseen the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her judas traitor i ejaculated you are a hypocrite too are you a deliberate deceiver who is nelly said catherines voice at my elbow i had been over intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance your worthless friend i answered warmly the sneaking rascal yonder ah he has caught a glimpse of us he is coming in i wonder will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to miss when he told you he hated her mrs linton saw isabella tear herself free and run into the garden and a minute after heathcliff opened the door i couldnt withhold giving some loose to my indignation but catherine angrily insisted on silence and threatened to order me out of the kitchen if i dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue to hear you people might think you were the mistress she cried you want setting down in your right place heathcliff what are you about raising this stir i said you must let isabella alone i beg you will unless you are tired of being received here and wish linton to draw the bolts against you god forbid that he should try answered the black villain i detested him just then god keep him meek and patient every day i grow madder after sending him to heaven hush said catherine shutting the inner door dont vex me why have you disregarded my request did she come across you on purpose what is it to you he growled i have a right to kiss her if she chooses and you have no right to object i am not your husband you neednt be jealous of me im not jealous of you replied the mistress im jealous for you clear your face you shant scowl at me if you like isabella you shall marry her but do you like her tell the truth heathcliff there you wont answer im certain you dont and would mr linton approve of his sister marrying that man i inquired mr linton should approve returned my lady decisively he might spare himself the trouble said heathcliff i could do as well without his approbation and as to you catherine i have a mind to speak a few words now while we are at it i want you to be aware that i know you have treated me infernally infernally do you hear and if you flatter yourself that i dont perceive it you are a fool and if you think i can be consoled by sweet words you are an idiot and if you fancy ill suffer unrevenged ill convince you of the contrary in a very little while meantime thank you for telling me your sister in laws secret i swear ill make the most of it and stand you aside what new phase of his character is this exclaimed mrs linton in amazement ive treated you infernally and youll take your revenge how will you take it ungrateful brute how have i treated you infernally i seek no revenge on you replied heathcliff less vehemently thats not the plan the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them you are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style and refrain from insult as much as you are able having levelled my palace dont erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home if i imagined you really wished me to marry isabel id cut my throat oh the evil is that i am not jealous is it cried catherine well i wont repeat my offer of a wife it is as bad as offering satan a lost soul your bliss lies like his in inflicting misery you prove it edgar is restored from the ill temper he gave way to at your coming i begin to be secure and tranquil and you restless to know us at peace appear resolved on exciting a quarrel quarrel with edgar if you please heathcliff and deceive his sister youll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me the conversation ceased mrs linton sat down by the fire flushed and gloomy the spirit which served her was growing intractable she could neither lay nor control it he stood on the hearth with folded arms brooding on his evil thoughts and in this position i left them to seek the master who was wondering what kept catherine below so long ellen said he when i entered have you seen your mistress yes shes in the kitchen sir i answered shes sadly put out by mr heathcliffs behaviour and indeed i do think its time to arrange his visits on another footing theres harm in being too soft and now its come to this and i related the scene in the court and as near as i dared the whole subsequent dispute i fancied it could not be very prejudicial to mrs linton unless she made it so afterwards by assuming the defensive for her guest edgar linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close his first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame this is insufferable he exclaimed it is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend and force his company on me call me two men out of the hall ellen catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian i have humoured her enough he descended and bidding the servants wait in the passage went followed by me to the kitchen its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion mrs linton at least was scolding with renewed vigour heathcliff had moved to the window and hung his head somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently he saw the master first and made a hasty motion that she should be silent which she obeyed abruptly on discovering the reason of his intimation how is this said linton addressing her what notion of propriety must you have to remain here after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard i suppose because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it you are habituated to his baseness and perhaps imagine i can get used to it too have you been listening at the door edgar asked the mistress in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation heathcliff who had raised his eyes at the former speech gave a sneering laugh at the latter on purpose it seemed to draw mr lintons attention to him he succeeded but edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion ive been so far forbearing with you sir he said quietly not that i was ignorant of your miserable degraded character but i felt you were only partly responsible for that and catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance i acquiesced foolishly your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous for that cause and to prevent worse consequences i shall deny you hereafter admission into this house and give notice now that i require your instant departure three minutes delay will render it involuntary and ignominious heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision cathy this lamb of yours threatens like a bull he said it is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles by god mr linton im mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down my master glanced towards the passage and signed me to fetch the men he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter i obeyed the hint but mrs linton suspecting something followed and when i attempted to call them she pulled me back slammed the door to and locked it fair means she said in answer to her husbands look of angry surprise if you have not courage to attack him make an apology or allow yourself to be beaten it will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess no ill swallow the key before you shall get it im delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each after constant indulgence of ones weak nature and the others bad one i earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude stupid to absurdity edgar i was defending you and yours and i wish heathcliff may flog you sick for daring to think an evil thought of me it did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master he tried to wrest the key from catherines grasp and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire whereupon mr edgar was taken with a nervous trembling and his countenance grew deadly pale for his life he could not avert that excess of emotion mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely he leant on the back of a chair and covered his face oh heavens in old days this would win you knighthood exclaimed mrs linton we are vanquished we are vanquished heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of mice cheer up you shant be hurt your type is not a lamb its a sucking leveret i wish you joy of the milk blooded coward cathy said her friend i compliment you on your taste and that is the slavering shivering thing you preferred to me i would not strike him with my fist but id kick him with my foot and experience considerable satisfaction is he weeping or is he going to faint for fear the fellow approached and gave the chair on which linton rested a push hed better have kept his distance my master quickly sprang erect and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man it took his breath for a minute and while he choked mr linton walked out by the back door into the yard and from thence to the front entrance there youve done with coming here cried catherine get away now hell return with a brace of pistols and half a dozen assistants if he did overhear us of course hed never forgive you youve played me an ill turn heathcliff but go make haste id rather see edgar at bay than you do you suppose im going with that blow burning in my gullet he thundered by hell no ill crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel nut before i cross the threshold if i dont floor him now i shall murder him some time so as you value his existence let me get at him he is not coming i interposed framing a bit of a lie theres the coachman and the two gardeners youll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them each has a bludgeon and master will very likely be watching from the parlour windows to see that they fulfil his orders the gardeners and coachman were there but linton was with them they had already entered the court heathcliff on the second thoughts resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings he seized the poker smashed the lock from the inner door and made his escape as they tramped in mrs linton who was very much excited bade me accompany her upstairs she did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance and i was anxious to keep her in ignorance im nearly distracted nelly she exclaimed throwing herself on the sofa a thousand smiths hammers are beating in my head tell isabella to shun me this uproar is owing to her and should she or any one else aggravate my anger at present i shall get wild and nelly say to edgar if you see him again to night that im in danger of being seriously ill i wish it may prove true he has startled and distressed me shockingly i want to frighten him besides he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings im certain i should recriminate and god knows where we should end will you do so my good nelly you are aware that i am no way blamable in this matter what possessed him to turn listener heathcliffs talk was outrageous after you left us but i could soon have diverted him from isabella and the rest meant nothing now all is dashed wrong by the fools craving to hear evil of self that haunts some people like a demon had edgar never gathered our conversation he would never have been the worse for it really when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after i had scolded heathcliff till i was hoarse for him i did not care hardly what they did to each other especially as i felt that however the scene closed we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long well if i cannot keep heathcliff for my friend if edgar will be mean and jealous ill try to break their hearts by breaking my own that will be a prompt way of finishing all when i am pushed to extremity but its a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope id not take linton by surprise with it to this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me you must represent the peril of quitting that policy and remind him of my passionate temper verging when kindled on frenzy i wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that countenance and look rather more anxious about me the stolidity with which i received these instructions was no doubt rather exasperating for they were delivered in perfect sincerity but i believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account beforehand might by exerting her will manage to control herself tolerably even while under their influence and i did not wish to frighten her husband as she said and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness therefore i said nothing when i met the master coming towards the parlour but i took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together he began to speak first remain where you are catherine he said without any anger in his voice but with much sorrowful despondency i shall not stay i am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled but i wish just to learn whether after this evenings events you intend to continue your intimacy with oh for mercys sake interrupted the mistress stamping her foot for mercys sake let us hear no more of it now your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever your veins are full of ice water but mine are boiling and the sight of such chillness makes them dance to get rid of me answer my question persevered mr linton you must answer it and that violence does not alarm me i have found that you can be as stoical as anyone when you please will you give up heathcliff hereafter or will you give up me it is impossible for you to be my friend and his at the same time and i absolutely require to know which you choose i require to be let alone exclaimed catherine furiously i demand it dont you see i can scarcely stand edgar you you leave me she rang the bell till it broke with a twang i entered leisurely it was enough to try the temper of a saint such senseless wicked rages there she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa and grinding her teeth so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters mr linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear he told me to fetch some water she had no breath for speaking i brought a glass full and as she would not drink i sprinkled it on her face in a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff and turned up her eyes while her cheeks at once blanched and livid assumed the aspect of death linton looked terrified there is nothing in the world the matter i whispered i did not want him to yield though i could not help being afraid in my heart she has blood on her lips he said shuddering never mind i answered tartly and i told him how she had resolved previous to his coming on exhibiting a fit of frenzy i incautiously gave the account aloud and she heard me for she started up her hair flying over her shoulders her eyes flashing the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally i made up my mind for broken bones at least but she only glared about her for an instant and then rushed from the room the master directed me to follow i did to her chamber door she hindered me from going further by securing it against me as she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning i went to ask whether she would have some carried up no she replied peremptorily the same question was repeated at dinner and tea and again on the morrow after and received the same answer mr linton on his part spent his time in the library and did not inquire concerning his wifes occupations isabella and he had had an hours interview during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for heathcliffs advances but he could make nothing of her evasive replies and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily adding however a solemn warning that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him
