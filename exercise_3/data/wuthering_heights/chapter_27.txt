seven days glided away every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of edgar lintons state the havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours catherine we would fain have deluded yet but her own quick spirit refused to delude her it divined in secret and brooded on the dreadful probability gradually ripening into certainty she had not the heart to mention her ride when thursday came round i mentioned it for her and obtained permission to order her out of doors for the library where her father stopped a short time daily the brief period he could bear to sit up and his chamber had become her whole world she grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow or seated by his side her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death he had a fixed idea i guessed by several observations he let fall that as his nephew resembled him in person he would resemble him in mind for lintons letters bore few or no indications of his defective character and i through pardonable weakness refrained from correcting the error asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account we deferred our excursion till the afternoon a golden afternoon of august every breath from the hills so full of life that it seemed whoever respired it though dying might revive catherines face was just like the landscape shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession but the shadows rested longer and the sunshine was more transient and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares we discerned linton watching at the same spot he had selected before my young mistress alighted and told me that as she was resolved to stay a very little while i had better hold the pony and remain on horseback but i dissented i wouldnt risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute so we climbed the slope of heath together master heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion not the animation of high spirits though nor yet of joy it looked more like fear it is late he said speaking short and with difficulty is not your father very ill i thought you wouldnt come why wont you be candid cried catherine swallowing her greeting why cannot you say at once you dont want me it is strange linton that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose apparently to distress us both and for no reason besides linton shivered and glanced at her half supplicating half ashamed but his cousins patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour my father is very ill she said and why am i called from his bedside why didnt you send to absolve me from my promise when you wished i wouldnt keep it come i desire an explanation playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind and i cant dance attendance on your affectations now my affectations he murmured what are they for heavens sake catherine dont look so angry despise me as much as you please i am a worthless cowardly wretch i cant be scorned enough but im too mean for your anger hate my father and spare me for contempt nonsense cried catherine in a passion foolish silly boy and there he trembles as if i were really going to touch him you neednt bespeak contempt linton anybody will have it spontaneously at your service get off i shall return home it is folly dragging you from the hearth stone and pretending what do we pretend let go my frock if i pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened you should spurn such pity ellen tell him how disgraceful this conduct is rise and dont degrade yourself into an abject reptile dont with streaming face and an expression of agony linton had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror oh he sobbed i cannot bear it catherine catherine im a traitor too and i dare not tell you but leave me and i shall be killed dear catherine my life is in your hands and you have said you loved me and if you did it wouldnt harm you youll not go then kind sweet good catherine and perhaps you will consent and hell let me die with you my young lady on witnessing his intense anguish stooped to raise him the old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed consent to what she asked to stay tell me the meaning of this strange talk and i will you contradict your own words and distract me be calm and frank and confess at once all that weighs on your heart you wouldnt injure me linton would you you wouldnt let any enemy hurt me if you could prevent it ill believe you are a coward for yourself but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend but my father threatened me gasped the boy clasping his attenuated fingers and i dread him i dread him i dare not tell oh well said catherine with scornful compassion keep your secret im no coward save yourself im not afraid her magnanimity provoked his tears he wept wildly kissing her supporting hands and yet could not summon courage to speak out i was cogitating what the mystery might be and determined catherine should never suffer to benefit him or any one else by my good will when hearing a rustle among the ling i looked up and saw mr heathcliff almost close upon us descending the heights he didnt cast a glance towards my companions though they were sufficiently near for lintons sobs to be audible but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides and the sincerity of which i couldnt avoid doubting he said it is something to see you so near to my house nelly how are you at the grange let us hear the rumour goes he added in a lower tone that edgar linton is on his death bed perhaps they exaggerate his illness no my master is dying i replied it is true enough a sad thing it will be for us all but a blessing for him how long will he last do you think he asked i dont know i said because he continued looking at the two young people who were fixed under his eye linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head and catherine could not move on his account because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me and id thank his uncle to be quick and go before him hallo has the whelp been playing that game long i did give him some lessons about snivelling is he pretty lively with miss linton generally lively no he has shown the greatest distress i answered to see him i should say that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills he ought to be in bed under the hands of a doctor he shall be in a day or two muttered heathcliff but first get up linton get up he shouted dont grovel on the ground there up this moment linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear caused by his fathers glance towards him i suppose there was nothing else to produce such humiliation he made several efforts to obey but his little strength was annihilated for the time and he fell back again with a moan mr heathcliff advanced and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf now said he with curbed ferocity im getting angry and if you dont command that paltry spirit of yours damn you get up directly i will father he panted only let me alone or i shall faint ive done as you wished im sure catherine will tell you that i that i have been cheerful ah keep by me catherine give me your hand take mine said his father stand on your feet there now shell lend you her arm thats right look at her you would imagine i was the devil himself miss linton to excite such horror be so kind as to walk home with him will you he shudders if i touch him linton dear whispered catherine i cant go to wuthering heights papa has forbidden me hell not harm you why are you so afraid i can never re enter that house he answered im not to re enter it without you stop cried his father well respect catherines filial scruples nelly take him in and ill follow your advice concerning the doctor without delay youll do well replied i but i must remain with my mistress to mind your son is not my business you are very stiff said heathcliff i know that but youll force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity come then my hero are you willing to return escorted by me he approached once more and made as if he would seize the fragile being but shrinking back linton clung to his cousin and implored her to accompany him with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial however i disapproved i couldnt hinder her indeed how could she have refused him herself what was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning but there he was powerless under its gripe and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy we reached the threshold catherine walked in and i stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair expecting her out immediately when mr heathcliff pushing me forward exclaimed my house is not stricken with the plague nelly and i have a mind to be hospitable to day sit down and allow me to shut the door he shut and locked it also i started you shall have tea before you go home he added i am by myself hareton is gone with some cattle to the lees and zillah and joseph are off on a journey of pleasure and though im used to being alone id rather have some interesting company if i can get it miss linton take your seat by him i give you what i have the present is hardly worth accepting but i have nothing else to offer it is linton i mean how she does stare its odd what a savage feeling i have to anything that seems afraid of me had i been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty i should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those two as an evenings amusement he drew in his breath struck the table and swore to himself by hell i hate them i am not afraid of you exclaimed catherine who could not hear the latter part of his speech she stepped close up her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution give me that key i will have it she said i wouldnt eat or drink here if i were starving heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table he looked up seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness or possibly reminded by her voice and glance of the person from whom she inherited it she snatched at the instrument and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers but her action recalled him to the present he recovered it speedily now catherine linton he said stand off or i shall knock you down and that will make mrs dean mad regardless of this warning she captured his closed hand and its contents again we will go she repeated exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax and finding that her nails made no impression she applied her teeth pretty sharply heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face he opened them suddenly and resigned the object of dispute but ere she had well secured it he seized her with the liberated hand and pulling her on his knee administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat had she been able to fall at this diabolical violence i rushed on him furiously you villain i began to cry you villain a touch on the chest silenced me i am stout and soon put out of breath and what with that and the rage i staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate or to burst a blood vessel the scene was over in two minutes catherine released put her two hands to her temples and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on she trembled like a reed poor thing and leant against the table perfectly bewildered i know how to chastise children you see said the scoundrel grimly as he stooped to repossess himself of the key which had dropped to the floor go to linton now as i told you and cry at your ease i shall be your father to morrow all the father youll have in a few days and you shall have plenty of that you can bear plenty youre no weakling you shall have a daily taste if i catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again cathy ran to me instead of linton and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap weeping aloud her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle as quiet as a mouse congratulating himself i dare say that the correction had alighted on another than him mr heathcliff perceiving us all confounded rose and expeditiously made the tea himself the cups and saucers were laid ready he poured it out and handed me a cup wash away your spleen he said and help your own naughty pet and mine it is not poisoned though i prepared it im going out to seek your horses our first thought on his departure was to force an exit somewhere we tried the kitchen door but that was fastened outside we looked at the windows they were too narrow for even cathys little figure master linton i cried seeing we were regularly imprisoned you know what your diabolical father is after and you shall tell us or ill box your ears as he has done your cousins yes linton you must tell said catherine it was for your sake i came and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse give me some tea im thirsty and then ill tell you he answered mrs dean go away i dont like you standing over me now catherine you are letting your tears fall into my cup i wont drink that give me another catherine pushed another to him and wiped her face i felt disgusted at the little wretchs composure since he was no longer in terror for himself the anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered wuthering heights so i guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there and that accomplished he had no further immediate fears papa wants us to be married he continued after sipping some of the liquid and he knows your papa wouldnt let us marry now and hes afraid of my dying if we wait so we are to be married in the morning and you are to stay here all night and if you do as he wishes you shall return home next day and take me with you take you with her pitiful changeling i exclaimed you marry why the man is mad or he thinks us fools every one and do you imagine that beautiful young lady that healthy hearty girl will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you are you cherishing the notion that anybody let alone miss catherine linton would have you for a husband you want whipping for bringing us in here at all with your dastardly puling tricks and dont look so silly now ive a very good mind to shake you severely for your contemptible treachery and your imbecile conceit i did give him a slight shaking but it brought on the cough and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping and catherine rebuked me stay all night no she said looking slowly round ellen ill burn that door down but ill get out and she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly but linton was up in alarm for his dear self again he clasped her in his two feeble arms sobbing wont you have me and save me not let me come to the grange oh darling catherine you mustnt go and leave after all you must obey my father you must i must obey my own she replied and relieve him from this cruel suspense the whole night what would he think hell be distressed already ill either break or burn a way out of the house be quiet youre in no danger but if you hinder me linton i love papa better than you the mortal terror he felt of mr heathcliffs anger restored to the boy his cowards eloquence catherine was near distraught still she persisted that she must go home and tried entreaty in her turn persuading him to subdue his selfish agony while they were thus occupied our jailor re entered your beasts have trotted off he said and now linton snivelling again what has she been doing to you come come have done and get to bed in a month or two my lad youll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand youre pining for pure love are you not nothing else in the world and she shall have you there to bed zillah wont be here to night you must undress yourself hush hold your noise once in your own room ill not come near you you neednt fear by chance youve managed tolerably ill look to the rest he spoke these words holding the door open for his son to pass and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze the lock was re secured heathcliff approached the fire where my mistress and i stood silent catherine looked up and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness but he scowled on her and muttered oh you are not afraid of me your courage is well disguised you seem damnably afraid i am afraid now she replied because if i stay papa will be miserable and how can i endure making him miserable when he when he mr heathcliff let me go home i promise to marry linton papa would like me to and i love him why should you wish to force me to do what ill willingly do of myself let him dare to force you i cried theres law in the land thank god there is though we be in an out of the way place id inform if he were my own son and its felony without benefit of clergy silence said the ruffian to the devil with your clamour i dont want you to speak miss linton i shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable i shall not sleep for satisfaction you could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next twenty four hours than informing me that such an event would follow as to your promise to marry linton ill take care you shall keep it for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled send ellen then to let papa know im safe exclaimed catherine weeping bitterly or marry me now poor papa ellen hell think were lost what shall we do not he hell think you are tired of waiting on him and run off for a little amusement answered heathcliff you cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary and it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age and that you would weary of nursing a sick man and that man only your father catherine his happiest days were over when your days began he cursed you i dare say for coming into the world i did at least and it would just do if he cursed you as he went out of it id join him i dont love you how should i weep away as far as i can see it will be your chief diversion hereafter unless linton make amends for other losses and your provident parent appears to fancy he may his letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly in his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his and kind to her when he got her careful and kind thats paternal but linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself linton can play the little tyrant well hell undertake to torture any number of cats if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared youll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his kindness when you get home again i assure you youre right there i said explain your sons character show his resemblance to yourself and then i hope miss cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice i dont much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now he answered because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner and you along with her till your master dies i can detain you both quite concealed here if you doubt encourage her to retract her word and youll have an opportunity of judging ill not retract my word said catherine ill marry him within this hour if i may go to thrushcross grange afterwards mr heathcliff youre a cruel man but youre not a fiend and you wont from mere malice destroy irrevocably all my happiness if papa thought i had left him on purpose and if he died before i returned could i bear to live ive given over crying but im going to kneel here at your knee and ill not get up and ill not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me no dont turn away do look youll see nothing to provoke you i dont hate you im not angry that you struck me have you never loved anybody in all your life uncle never ah you must look once im so wretched you cant help being sorry and pitying me keep your efts fingers off and move or ill kick you cried heathcliff brutally repulsing her id rather be hugged by a snake how the devil can you dream of fawning on me i detest you he shrugged his shoulders shook himself indeed as if his flesh crept with aversion and thrust back his chair while i got up and opened my mouth to commence a downright torrent of abuse but i was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence by a threat that i should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable i uttered it was growing dark we heard a sound of voices at the garden gate our host hurried out instantly he had his wits about him we had not there was a talk of two or three minutes and he returned alone i thought it had been your cousin hareton i observed to catherine i wish he would arrive who knows but he might take our part it was three servants sent to seek you from the grange said heathcliff overhearing me you should have opened a lattice and called out but i could swear that chit is glad you didnt shes glad to be obliged to stay im certain at learning the chance we had missed we both gave vent to our grief without control and he allowed us to wail on till nine oclock then he bid us go upstairs through the kitchen to zillahs chamber and i whispered my companion to obey perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there or into a garret and out by its skylight the window however was narrow like those below and the garret trap was safe from our attempts for we were fastened in as before we neither of us lay down catherine took her station by the lattice and watched anxiously for morning a deep sigh being the only answer i could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest i seated myself in a chair and rocked to and fro passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty from which it struck me then all the misfortunes of my employers sprang it was not the case in reality i am aware but it was in my imagination that dismal night and i thought heathcliff himself less guilty than i at seven oclock he came and inquired if miss linton had risen she ran to the door immediately and answered yes here then he said opening it and pulling her out i rose to follow but he turned the lock again i demanded my release be patient he replied ill send up your breakfast in a while i thumped on the panels and rattled the latch angrily and catherine asked why i was still shut up he answered i must try to endure it another hour and they went away i endured it two or three hours at length i heard a footstep not heathcliffs ive brought you something to eat said a voice oppen t door complying eagerly i beheld hareton laden with food enough to last me all day tak it he added thrusting the tray into my hand stay one minute i began nay cried he and retired regardless of any prayers i could pour forth to detain him and there i remained enclosed the whole day and the whole of the next night and another and another five nights and four days i remained altogether seeing nobody but hareton once every morning and he was a model of a jailor surly and dumb and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion
