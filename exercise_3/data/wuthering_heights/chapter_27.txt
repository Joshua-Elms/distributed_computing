on the fifth morning or rather afternoon a different step approached lighter and shorter and this time the person entered the room it was zillah donned in her scarlet shawl with a black silk bonnet on her head and a willow basket swung to her arm eh dear mrs dean she exclaimed well there is a talk about you at gimmerton i never thought but you were sunk in the blackhorse marsh and missy with you till master told me youd been found and hed lodged you here what and you must have got on an island sure and how long were you in the hole did master save you mrs dean but youre not so thin youve not been so poorly have you your master is a true scoundrel i replied but he shall answer for it he neednt have raised that tale it shall all be laid bare what do you mean asked zillah its not his tale they tell that in the village about your being lost in the marsh and i calls to earnshaw when i come in eh theys queer things mr hareton happened since i went off its a sad pity of that likely young lass and cant nelly dean he stared i thought he had not heard aught so i told him the rumour the master listened and he just smiled to himself and said if they have been in the marsh they are out now zillah nelly dean is lodged at this minute in your room you can tell her to flit when you go up here is the key the bog water got into her head and she would have run home quite flighty but i fixed her till she came round to her senses you can bid her go to the grange at once if she be able and carry a message from me that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squires funeral mr edgar is not dead i gasped oh zillah zillah no no sit you down my good mistress she replied youre right sickly yet hes not dead doctor kenneth thinks he may last another day i met him on the road and asked instead of sitting down i snatched my outdoor things and hastened below for the way was free on entering the house i looked about for some one to give information of catherine the place was filled with sunshine and the door stood wide open but nobody seemed at hand as i hesitated whether to go off at once or return and seek my mistress a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth linton lay on the settle sole tenant sucking a stick of sugar candy and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes where is miss catherine i demanded sternly supposing i could frighten him into giving intelligence by catching him thus alone he sucked on like an innocent is she gone i said no he replied shes upstairs shes not to go we wont let her you wont let her little idiot i exclaimed direct me to her room immediately or ill make you sing out sharply papa would make you sing out if you attempted to get there he answered he says im not to be soft with catherine shes my wife and its shameful that she should wish to leave me he says she hates me and wants me to die that she may have my money but she shant have it and she shant go home she never shall she may cry and be sick as much as she pleases he resumed his former occupation closing his lids as if he meant to drop asleep master heathcliff i resumed have you forgotten all catherines kindness to you last winter when you affirmed you loved her and when she brought you books and sung you songs and came many a time through wind and snow to see you she wept to miss one evening because you would be disappointed and you felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you and now you believe the lies your father tells though you know he detests you both and you join him against her thats fine gratitude is it not the corner of lintons mouth fell and he took the sugar candy from his lips did she come to wuthering heights because she hated you i continued think for yourself as to your money she does not even know that you will have any and you say shes sick and yet you leave her alone up there in a strange house you who have felt what it is to be so neglected you could pity your own sufferings and she pitied them too but you wont pity hers i shed tears master heathcliff you see an elderly woman and a servant merely and you after pretending such affection and having reason to worship her almost store every tear you have for yourself and lie there quite at ease ah youre a heartless selfish boy i cant stay with her he answered crossly ill not stay by myself she cries so i cant bear it and she wont give over though i say ill call my father i did call him once and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet but she began again the instant he left the room moaning and grieving all night long though i screamed for vexation that i couldnt sleep is mr heathcliff out i inquired perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathise with his cousins mental tortures hes in the court he replied talking to doctor kenneth who says uncle is dying truly at last im glad for i shall be master of the grange after him catherine always spoke of it as her house it isnt hers its mine papa says everything she has is mine all her nice books are mine she offered to give me them and her pretty birds and her pony minny if i would get the key of our room and let her out but i told her she had nothing to give they were all all mine and then she cried and took a little picture from her neck and said i should have that two pictures in a gold case on one side her mother and on the other uncle when they were young that was yesterday i said they were mine too and tried to get them from her the spiteful thing wouldnt let me she pushed me off and hurt me i shrieked out that frightens her she heard papa coming and she broke the hinges and divided the case and gave me her mothers portrait the other she attempted to hide but papa asked what was the matter and i explained it he took the one i had away and ordered her to resign hers to me she refused and he he struck her down and wrenched it off the chain and crushed it with his foot and were you pleased to see her struck i asked having my designs in encouraging his talk i winked he answered i wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse he does it so hard yet i was glad at first she deserved punishing for pushing me but when papa was gone she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside against her teeth and her mouth filling with blood and then she gathered up the bits of the picture and went and sat down with her face to the wall and she has never spoken to me since and i sometimes think she cant speak for pain i dont like to think so but shes a naughty thing for crying continually and she looks so pale and wild im afraid of her and you can get the key if you choose i said yes when i am upstairs he answered but i cant walk upstairs now in what apartment is it i asked oh he cried i shant tell you where it is it is our secret nobody neither hareton nor zillah is to know there youve tired me go away go away and he turned his face on to his arm and shut his eyes again i considered it best to depart without seeing mr heathcliff and bring a rescue for my young lady from the grange on reaching it the astonishment of my fellow servants to see me and their joy also was intense and when they heard that their little mistress was safe two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at mr edgars door but i bespoke the announcement of it myself how changed i found him even in those few days he lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting his death very young he looked though his actual age was thirty nine one would have called him ten years younger at least he thought of catherine for he murmured her name i touched his hand and spoke catherine is coming dear master i whispered she is alive and well and will be here i hope to night i trembled at the first effects of this intelligence he half rose up looked eagerly round the apartment and then sank back in a swoon as soon as he recovered i related our compulsory visit and detention at the heights i said heathcliff forced me to go in which was not quite true i uttered as little as possible against linton nor did i describe all his fathers brutal conduct my intentions being to add no bitterness if i could help it to his already overflowing cup he divined that one of his enemys purposes was to secure the personal property as well as the estate to his son or rather himself yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together however he felt that his will had better be altered instead of leaving catherines fortune at her own disposal he determined to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life and for her children if she had any after her by that means it could not fall to mr heathcliff should linton die having received his orders i despatched a man to fetch the attorney and four more provided with serviceable weapons to demand my young lady of her jailor both parties were delayed very late the single servant returned first he said mr green the lawyer was out when he arrived at his house and he had to wait two hours for his re entrance and then mr green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done but he would be at thrushcross grange before morning the four men came back unaccompanied also they brought word that catherine was ill too ill to quit her room and heathcliff would not suffer them to see her i scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale which i would not carry to my master resolving to take a whole bevy up to the heights at daylight and storm it literally unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us her father shall see her i vowed and vowed again if that devil be killed on his own door stones in trying to prevent it happily i was spared the journey and the trouble i had gone downstairs at three oclock to fetch a jug of water and was passing through the hall with it in my hand when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump oh it is green i said recollecting myself only green and i went on intending to send somebody else to open it but the knock was repeated not loud and still importunately i put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself the harvest moon shone clear outside it was not the attorney my own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck sobbing ellen ellen is papa alive yes i cried yes my angel he is god be thanked you are safe with us again she wanted to run breathless as she was upstairs to mr lintons room but i compelled her to sit down on a chair and made her drink and washed her pale face chafing it into a faint colour with my apron then i said i must go first and tell of her arrival imploring her to say she should be happy with young heathcliff she stared but soon comprehending why i counselled her to utter the falsehood she assured me she would not complain i couldnt abide to be present at their meeting i stood outside the chamber door a quarter of an hour and hardly ventured near the bed then all was composed however catherines despair was as silent as her fathers joy she supported him calmly in appearance and he fixed on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy he died blissfully mr lockwood he died so kissing her cheek he murmured i am going to her and you darling child shall come to us and never stirred or spoke again but continued that rapt radiant gaze till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed none could have noticed the exact minute of his death it was so entirely without a struggle whether catherine had spent her tears or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow she sat there dry eyed till the sun rose she sat till noon and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed but i insisted on her coming away and taking some repose it was well i succeeded in removing her for at dinner time appeared the lawyer having called at wuthering heights to get his instructions how to behave he had sold himself to mr heathcliff that was the cause of his delay in obeying my masters summons fortunately no thought of worldly affairs crossed the latters mind to disturb him after his daughters arrival mr green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place he gave all the servants but me notice to quit he would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that edgar linton should not be buried beside his wife but in the chapel with his family there was the will however to hinder that and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions the funeral was hurried over catherine mrs linton heathcliff now was suffered to stay at the grange till her fathers corpse had quitted it she told me that her anguish had at last spurred linton to incur the risk of liberating her she heard the men i sent disputing at the door and she gathered the sense of heathcliffs answer it drove her desperate linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after i left was terrified into fetching the key before his father re ascended he had the cunning to unlock and re lock the door without shutting it and when he should have gone to bed he begged to sleep with hareton and his petition was granted for once catherine stole out before break of day she dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm she visited the empty chambers and examined their windows and luckily lighting on her mothers she got easily out of its lattice and on to the ground by means of the fir tree close by her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape notwithstanding his timid contrivances
