summer drew to an end and early autumn it was past michaelmas but the harvest was late that year and a few of our fields were still uncleared mr linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk and the evening happening to be chill and damp my master caught a bad cold that settled obstinately on his lungs and confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter nearly without intermission poor cathy frightened from her little romance had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment and her father insisted on her reading less and taking more exercise she had his companionship no longer i esteemed it a duty to supply its lack as much as possible with mine an inefficient substitute for i could only spare two or three hours from my numerous diurnal occupations to follow her footsteps and then my society was obviously less desirable than his on an afternoon in october or the beginning of november a fresh watery afternoon when the turf and paths were rustling with moist withered leaves and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds dark grey streamers rapidly mounting from the west and boding abundant rain i requested my young lady to forego her ramble because i was certain of showers she refused and i unwillingly donned a cloak and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park a formal walk which she generally affected if low spirited and that she invariably was when mr edgar had been worse than ordinary a thing never known from his confession but guessed both by her and me from his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance she went sadly on there was no running or bounding now though the chill wind might well have tempted her to race and often from the side of my eye i could detect her raising a hand and brushing something off her cheek i gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts on one side of the road rose a high rough bank where hazels and stunted oaks with their roots half exposed held uncertain tenure the soil was too loose for the latter and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal in summer miss catherine delighted to climb along these trunks and sit in the branches swinging twenty feet above the ground and i pleased with her agility and her light childish heart still considered it proper to scold every time i caught her at such an elevation but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending from dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze rocked cradle doing nothing except singing old songs my nursery lore to herself or watching the birds joint tenants feed and entice their young ones to fly or nestling with closed lids half thinking half dreaming happier than words can express look miss i exclaimed pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree winter is not here yet theres a little flower up yonder the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in july with a lilac mist will you clamber up and pluck it to show to papa cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter and replied at length no ill not touch it but it looks melancholy does it not ellen yes i observed about as starved and sackless as you your cheeks are bloodless let us take hold of hands and run youre so low i daresay i shall keep up with you no she repeated and continued sauntering on pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss or a tuft of blanched grass or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage and ever and anon her hand was lifted to her averted face catherine why are you crying love i asked approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder you mustnt cry because papa has a cold be thankful it is nothing worse she now put no further restraint on her tears her breath was stifled by sobs oh it will be something worse she said and what shall i do when papa and you leave me and i am by myself i cant forget your words ellen they are always in my ear how life will be changed how dreary the world will be when papa and you are dead none can tell whether you wont die before us i replied its wrong to anticipate evil well hope there are years and years to come before any of us go master is young and i am strong and hardly forty five my mother lived till eighty a canty dame to the last and suppose mr linton were spared till he saw sixty that would be more years than you have counted miss and would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand but aunt isabella was younger than papa she remarked gazing up with timid hope to seek further consolation aunt isabella had not you and me to nurse her i replied she wasnt as happy as master she hadnt as much to live for all you need do is to wait well on your father and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject mind that cathy ill not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless and cherished a foolish fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make i fret about nothing on earth except papas illness answered my companion i care for nothing in comparison with papa and ill never never oh never while i have my senses do an act or say a word to vex him i love him better than myself ellen and i know it by this i pray every night that i may live after him because i would rather be miserable than that he should be that proves i love him better than myself good words i replied but deeds must prove it also and after he is well remember you dont forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear as we talked we neared a door that opened on the road and my young lady lightening into sunshine again climbed up and seated herself on the top of the wall reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild rose trees shadowing the highway side the lower fruit had disappeared but only birds could touch the upper except from cathys present station in stretching to pull them her hat fell off and as the door was locked she proposed scrambling down to recover it i bid her be cautious lest she got a fall and she nimbly disappeared but the return was no such easy matter the stones were smooth and neatly cemented and the rosebushes and blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in re ascending i like a fool didnt recollect that till i heard her laughing and exclaiming ellen youll have to fetch the key or else i must run round to the porters lodge i cant scale the ramparts on this side stay where you are i answered i have my bundle of keys in my pocket perhaps i may manage to open it if not ill go catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door while i tried all the large keys in succession i had applied the last and found that none would do so repeating my desire that she would remain there i was about to hurry home as fast as i could when an approaching sound arrested me it was the trot of a horse cathys dance stopped also who is that i whispered ellen i wish you could open the door whispered back my companion anxiously ho miss linton cried a deep voice the riders im glad to meet you dont be in haste to enter for i have an explanation to ask and obtain i shant speak to you mr heathcliff answered catherine papa says you are a wicked man and you hate both him and me and ellen says the same that is nothing to the purpose said heathcliff he it was i dont hate my son i suppose and it is concerning him that i demand your attention yes you have cause to blush two or three months since were you not in the habit of writing to linton making love in play eh you deserved both of you flogging for that you especially the elder and less sensitive as it turns out ive got your letters and if you give me any pertness ill send them to your father i presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it didnt you well you dropped linton with it into a slough of despond he was in earnest in love really as true as i live hes dying for you breaking his heart at your fickleness not figuratively but actually though hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks and i have used more serious measures and attempted to frighten him out of his idiocy he gets worse daily and hell be under the sod before summer unless you restore him how can you lie so glaringly to the poor child i called from the inside pray ride on how can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods miss cathy ill knock the lock off with a stone you wont believe that vile nonsense you can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger i was not aware there were eavesdroppers muttered the detected villain worthy mrs dean i like you but i dont like your double dealing he added aloud how could you lie so glaringly as to affirm i hated the poor child and invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my door stones catherine linton the very name warms me my bonny lass i shall be from home all this week go and see if i have not spoken truth do theres a darling just imagine your father in my place and linton in yours then think how you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you when your father himself entreated him and dont from pure stupidity fall into the same error i swear on my salvation hes going to his grave and none but you can save him the lock gave way and i issued out i swear linton is dying repeated heathcliff looking hard at me and grief and disappointment are hastening his death nelly if you wont let her go you can walk over yourself but i shall not return till this time next week and i think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin come in said i taking cathy by the arm and half forcing her to re enter for she lingered viewing with troubled eyes the features of the speaker too stern to express his inward deceit he pushed his horse close and bending down observed miss catherine ill own to you that i have little patience with linton and hareton and joseph have less ill own that hes with a harsh set he pines for kindness as well as love and a kind word from you would be his best medicine dont mind mrs deans cruel cautions but be generous and contrive to see him he dreams of you day and night and cannot be persuaded that you dont hate him since you neither write nor call i closed the door and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it and spreading my umbrella i drew my charge underneath for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees and warned us to avoid delay our hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with heathcliff as we stretched towards home but i divined instinctively that catherines heart was clouded now in double darkness her features were so sad they did not seem hers she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true the master had retired to rest before we came in cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was he had fallen asleep she returned and asked me to sit with her in the library we took our tea together and afterwards she lay down on the rug and told me not to talk for she was weary i got a book and pretended to read as soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation she recommenced her silent weeping it appeared at present her favourite diversion i suffered her to enjoy it a while then i expostulated deriding and ridiculing all mr heathcliffs assertions about his son as if i were certain she would coincide alas i hadnt skill to counteract the effect his account had produced it was just what he intended you may be right ellen she answered but i shall never feel at ease till i know and i must tell linton it is not my fault that i dont write and convince him that i shall not change what use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity we parted that night hostile but next day beheld me on the road to wuthering heights by the side of my wilful young mistresss pony i couldnt bear to witness her sorrow to see her pale dejected countenance and heavy eyes and i yielded in the faint hope that linton himself might prove by his reception of us how little of the tale was founded on fact
