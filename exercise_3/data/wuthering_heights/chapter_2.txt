while leading the way upstairs she recommended that i should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly i asked the reason she did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious too stupefied to be curious myself i fastened my door and glanced round for the bed the whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothes press and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows having approached this structure i looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of old fashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself in fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table i slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of heathcliff and every one else the ledge where i placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint this writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and small catherine earnshaw here and there varied to catherine heathcliff and then again to catherine linton in vapid listlessness i leant my head against the window and continued spelling over catherine earnshaw heathcliff linton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectres the air swarmed with catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name i discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf skin i snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee it was a testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a fly leaf bore the inscription catherine earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back i shut it and took up another and another till i had examined all catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a pen and ink commentary at least the appearance of one covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand at the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on i was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend joseph rudely yet powerfully sketched an immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown catherine and i began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics an awful sunday commenced the paragraph beneath i wish my father were back again hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to heathcliff is atrocious h and i are going to rebel we took our initiatory step this evening all day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire doing anything but reading their bibles ill answer for it heathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake a vain idea the service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending what done already on sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners you forget you have a master here says the tyrant ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper i insist on perfect sobriety and silence oh boy was that you frances darling pull his hair as you go by i heard him snap his fingers frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hour foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of we made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser i had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes joseph on an errand from the stables he tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks t maister nobbut just buried and sabbath not oered und t sound o t gospel still i yer lugs and ye darr be laiking shame on ye sit ye down ill childer theres good books eneugh if yell read em sit ye down and think o yer sowls saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the far off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber he thrust upon us i could not bear the employment i took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing i hated a good book heathcliff kicked his to the same place then there was a hubbub maister hindley shouted our chaplain maister coom hither miss cathys riven th back off th helmet o salvation un heathcliffs pawsed his fit into t first part o t brooad way to destruction its fair flaysome that ye let em go on this gait ech th owd man wad ha laced em properly but hes goan hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where joseph asseverated owd nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent i reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and i have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter a pleasant suggestion and then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verified we cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here * * * * * * i suppose catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence took up another subject she waxed lachrymose how little did i dream that hindley would ever make me cry so she wrote my head aches till i cannot keep it on the pillow and still i cant give over poor heathcliff hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and i must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders he has been blaming our father how dared he for treating h too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place * * * * * * i began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print i saw a red ornamented title seventy times seven and the first of the seventy first a pious discourse delivered by the reverend jabez branderham in the chapel of gimmerden sough and while i was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what jabez branderham would make of his subject i sank back in bed and fell asleep alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night i dont remember another that i can at all compare with it since i was capable of suffering i began to dream almost before i ceased to be sensible of my locality i thought it was morning and i had set out on my way home with joseph for a guide the snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that i had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that i could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavy headed cudgel which i understood to be so denominated for a moment i considered it absurd that i should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence then a new idea flashed across me i was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous jabez branderham preach from the text seventy times seven and either joseph the preacher or i had committed the first of the seventy first and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated we came to the chapel i have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there the roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets however in my dream jabez had a full and attentive congregation and he preached good god what a sermon divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin where he searched for them i cannot tell he had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion they were of the most curious character odd transgressions that i never imagined previously oh how weary i grew how i writhed and yawned and nodded and revived how i pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged joseph to inform me if he would ever have done i was condemned to hear all out finally he reached the first of the seventy first at that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me i was moved to rise and denounce jabez branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon sir i exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch i have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse seventy times seven times have i plucked up my hat and been about to depart seventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat the four hundred and ninety first is too much fellow martyrs have at him drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more thou art the man cried jabez after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visage seventy times seven did i take counsel with my soul lo this is human weakness this also may be absolved the first of the seventy first is come brethren execute upon him the judgment written such honour have all his saints with that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and i having no weapon to raise in self defence commenced grappling with joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his in the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult what had played jabezs part in the row merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes i listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before this time i remembered i was lying in the oak closet and i heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow i heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that i resolved to silence it if possible and i thought i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement the hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten i must stop it nevertheless i muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little ice cold hand the intense horror of nightmare came over me i tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed let me in let me in who are you i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself catherine linton it replied shiveringly why did i think of linton i had read earnshaw twenty times for linton im come home id lost my way on the moor as it spoke i discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed let me in and maintained its tenacious gripe almost maddening me with fear how can i i said at length let me go if you want me to let you in the fingers relaxed i snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant i listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on begone i shouted ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years it is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years ive been a waif for twenty years thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward i tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright to my confusion i discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed i sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself at last he said in a half whisper plainly not expecting an answer is any one here i considered it best to confess my presence for i knew heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if i kept quiet with this intention i turned and opened the panels i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up it is only your guest sir i called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare im sorry i disturbed you oh god confound you mr lockwood i wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady and who showed you up into this room he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions who was it ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment it was your servant zillah i replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments i should not care if you did mr heathcliff she richly deserves it i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense well it is swarming with ghosts and goblins you have reason in shutting it up i assure you no one will thank you for a doze in such a den what do you mean asked heathcliff and what are you doing lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heavens sake dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut if the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me i returned im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again was not the reverend jabez branderham akin to you on the mothers side and that minx catherine linton or earnshaw or however she was called she must have been a changeling wicked little soul she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions ive no doubt scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of heathcliffs with catherines name in the book which had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened i blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence i hastened to add the truth is sir i passed the first part of the night in here i stopped afresh i was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself i went on in spelling over the name scratched on that window ledge a monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or what can you mean by talking in this way to me thundered heathcliff with savage vehemence how how dare you under my roof god hes mad to speak so and he struck his forehead with rage i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming i had never heard the appellation of catherine linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as i spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it i guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict i continued my toilette rather noisily looked at my watch and soliloquised on the length of the night not three oclock yet i could have taken oath it had been six time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight always at nine in winter and rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as i fancied by the motion of his arms shadow dashing a tear from his eyes mr lockwood he added you may go into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me and for me too i replied ill walk in the yard till daylight and then ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself delightful company muttered heathcliff take the candle and go where you please i shall join you directly keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the house juno mounts sentinel there and nay you can only ramble about the steps and passages but away with you ill come in two minutes i obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led i stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense he got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears come in come in he sobbed cathy do come oh do once more oh my hearts darling hear me this time catherine at last the spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light there was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and i drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension i descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle nothing was stirring except a brindled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these i stretched myself and grimalkin mounted the other we were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat and then it was joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret i suppose he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a three inch pipe with tobacco my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came a more elastic footstep entered next and now i opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for hareton earnshaw was performing his orison sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts he glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat i guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him he noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go if i changed my locality it opened into the house where the females were already astir zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and mrs heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze she held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face i was surprised to see heathcliff there also he stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene with poor zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan and you you worthless he broke out as i entered turning to his daughter in law and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash there you are at your idle tricks again the rest of them do earn their bread you live on my charity put your trash away and find something to do you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sight do you hear damnable jade ill put my trash away because you can make me if i refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair but ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what i please heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight having no desire to be entertained by a cat and dog combat i stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities heathcliff placed his fists out of temptation in his pockets mrs heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay that was not long i declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice my landlord halloed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor it was well he did for the whole hill back was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind i had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when i imagined i was following correctly the windings of the road we exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park saying i could make no error there our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then i pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles i believe i managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate at any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that i perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains i bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart i dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat i adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment
