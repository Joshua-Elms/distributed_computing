yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold i had half a mind to spend it by my study fire instead of wading through heath and mud to wuthering heights on coming up from dinner however n b i dine between twelve and one oclock the housekeeper a matronly lady taken as a fixture along with the house could not or would not comprehend my request that i might be served at five on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention and stepping into the room i saw a servant girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal scuttles and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders this spectacle drove me back immediately i took my hat and after a four miles walk arrived at heathcliffs garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower on that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost and the air made me shiver through every limb being unable to remove the chain i jumped over and running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes knocked vainly for admittance till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled wretched inmates i ejaculated mentally you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality at least i would not keep my doors barred in the day time i dont care i will get in so resolved i grasped the latch and shook it vehemently vinegar faced joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn what are ye for he shouted t maisters down i t fowld go round by th end o t laith if ye went to spake to him is there nobody inside to open the door i hallooed responsively theres nobbut t missis and shooll not oppen t an ye mak yer flaysome dins till neeght why cannot you tell her whom i am eh joseph nor ne me ill hae no hend wit muttered the head vanishing the snow began to drive thickly i seized the handle to essay another trial when a young man without coat and shouldering a pitchfork appeared in the yard behind he hailed me to follow him and after marching through a wash house and a paved area containing a coal shed pump and pigeon cot we at length arrived in the huge warm cheerful apartment where i was formerly received it glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire compounded of coal peat and wood and near the table laid for a plentiful evening meal i was pleased to observe the missis an individual whose existence i had never previously suspected i bowed and waited thinking she would bid me take a seat she looked at me leaning back in her chair and remained motionless and mute rough weather i remarked im afraid mrs heathcliff the door must bear the consequence of your servants leisure attendance i had hard work to make them hear me she never opened her mouth i stared she stared also at any rate she kept her eyes on me in a cool regardless manner exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable sit down said the young man gruffly hell be in soon i obeyed and hemmed and called the villain juno who deigned at this second interview to move the extreme tip of her tail in token of owning my acquaintance a beautiful animal i commenced again do you intend parting with the little ones madam they are not mine said the amiable hostess more repellingly than heathcliff himself could have replied ah your favourites are among these i continued turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats a strange choice of favourites she observed scornfully unluckily it was a heap of dead rabbits i hemmed once more and drew closer to the hearth repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening you should not have come out she said rising and reaching from the chimney piece two of the painted canisters her position before was sheltered from the light now i had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance she was slender and apparently scarcely past girlhood an admirable form and the most exquisite little face that i have ever had the pleasure of beholding small features very fair flaxen ringlets or rather golden hanging loose on her delicate neck and eyes had they been agreeable in expression that would have been irresistible fortunately for my susceptible heart the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation singularly unnatural to be detected there the canisters were almost out of her reach i made a motion to aid her she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold i dont want your help she snapped i can get them for myself i beg your pardon i hastened to reply were you asked to tea she demanded tying an apron over her neat black frock and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot i shall be glad to have a cup i answered were you asked she repeated no i said half smiling you are the proper person to ask me she flung the tea back spoon and all and resumed her chair in a pet her forehead corrugated and her red under lip pushed out like a childs ready to cry meanwhile the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment and erecting himself before the blaze looked down on me from the corner of his eyes for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us i began to doubt whether he were a servant or not his dress and speech were both rude entirely devoid of the superiority observable in mr and mrs heathcliff his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer still his bearing was free almost haughty and he showed none of a domestics assiduity in attending on the lady of the house in the absence of clear proofs of his condition i deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct and five minutes afterwards the entrance of heathcliff relieved me in some measure from my uncomfortable state you see sir i am come according to promise i exclaimed assuming the cheerful and i fear i shall be weather bound for half an hour if you can afford me shelter during that space half an hour he said shaking the white flakes from his clothes i wonder you should select the thick of a snow storm to ramble about in do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes people familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings and i can tell you there is no chance of a change at present perhaps i can get a guide among your lads and he might stay at the grange till morning could you spare me one no i could not oh indeed well then i must trust to my own sagacity umph are you going to mak the tea demanded he of the shabby coat shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady is he to have any she asked appealing to heathcliff get it ready will you was the answer uttered so savagely that i started the tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature i no longer felt inclined to call heathcliff a capital fellow when the preparations were finished he invited me with now sir bring forward your chair and we all including the rustic youth drew round the table an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal i thought if i had caused the cloud it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it they could not every day sit so grim and taciturn and it was impossible however ill tempered they might be that the universal scowl they wore was their every day countenance it is strange i began in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving another it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend mr heathcliff yet ill venture to say that surrounded by your family and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart my amiable lady he interrupted with an almost diabolical sneer on his face where is she my amiable lady mrs heathcliff your wife i mean well yes oh you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel and guards the fortunes of wuthering heights even when her body is gone is that it perceiving myself in a blunder i attempted to correct it i might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife one was about forty a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years the other did not look seventeen then it flashed upon me the clown at my elbow who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands may be her husband heathcliff junior of course here is the consequence of being buried alive she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed a sad pity i must beware how i cause her to regret her choice the last reflection may seem conceited it was not my neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive i knew through experience that i was tolerably attractive mrs heathcliff is my daughter in law said heathcliff corroborating my surmise he turned as he spoke a peculiar look in her direction a look of hatred unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not like those of other people interpret the language of his soul ah certainly i see now you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy i remarked turning to my neighbour this was worse than before the youth grew crimson and clenched his fist with every appearance of a meditated assault but he seemed to recollect himself presently and smothered the storm in a brutal curse muttered on my behalf which however i took care not to notice unhappy in your conjectures sir observed my host we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy her mate is dead i said she was my daughter in law therefore she must have married my son and this young man is not my son assuredly heathcliff smiled again as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him my name is hareton earnshaw growled the other and id counsel you to respect it ive shown no disrespect was my reply laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself he fixed his eye on me longer than i cared to return the stare for fear i might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible i began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle the dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame and more than neutralised the glowing physical comforts round me and i resolved to be cautious how i ventured under those rafters a third time the business of eating being concluded and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation i approached a window to examine the weather a sorrowful sight i saw dark night coming down prematurely and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow i dont think it possible for me to get home now without a guide i could not help exclaiming the roads will be buried already and if they were bare i could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance hareton drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch theyll be covered if left in the fold all night and put a plank before them said heathcliff how must i do i continued with rising irritation there was no reply to my question and on looking round i saw only joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs and mrs heathcliff leaning over the fire diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimney piece as she restored the tea canister to its place the former when he had deposited his burden took a critical survey of the room and in cracked tones grated out aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i idleness un war when all on ems goan out bud yahre a nowt and its no use talking yahll niver mend oyer ill ways but goa raight to t divil like yer mother afore ye i imagined for a moment that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me and sufficiently enraged stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door mrs heathcliff however checked me by her answer you scandalous old hypocrite she replied are you not afraid of being carried away bodily whenever you mention the devils name i warn you to refrain from provoking me or ill ask your abduction as a special favour stop look here joseph she continued taking a long dark book from a shelf ill show you how far ive progressed in the black art i shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it the red cow didnt die by chance and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations oh wicked wicked gasped the elder may the lord deliver us from evil no reprobate you are a castaway be off or ill hurt you seriously ill have you all modelled in wax and clay and the first who passes the limits i fix shall ill not say what he shall be done to but youll see go im looking at you the little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes and joseph trembling with sincere horror hurried out praying and ejaculating wicked as he went i thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun and now that we were alone i endeavoured to interest her in my distress mrs heathcliff i said earnestly you must excuse me for troubling you i presume because with that face im sure you cannot help being good hearted do point out some landmarks by which i may know my way home i have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to london take the road you came she answered ensconcing herself in a chair with a candle and the long book open before her it is brief advice but as sound as i can give then if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow your conscience wont whisper that it is partly your fault how so i cannot escort you they wouldnt let me go to the end of the garden wall you i should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold for my convenience on such a night i cried i want you to tell me my way not to show it or else to persuade mr heathcliff to give me a guide who there is himself earnshaw zillah joseph and i which would you have are there no boys at the farm no those are all then it follows that i am compelled to stay that you may settle with your host i have nothing to do with it i hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills cried heathcliffs stern voice from the kitchen entrance as to staying here i dont keep accommodations for visitors you must share a bed with hareton or joseph if you do i can sleep on a chair in this room i replied no no a stranger is a stranger be he rich or poor it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the place while i am off guard said the unmannerly wretch with this insult my patience was at an end i uttered an expression of disgust and pushed past him into the yard running against earnshaw in my haste it was so dark that i could not see the means of exit and as i wandered round i heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other at first the young man appeared about to befriend me ill go with him as far as the park he said youll go with him to hell exclaimed his master or whatever relation he bore and who is to look after the horses eh a mans life is of more consequence than one evenings neglect of the horses somebody must go murmured mrs heathcliff more kindly than i expected not at your command retorted hareton if you set store on him youd better be quiet then i hope his ghost will haunt you and i hope mr heathcliff will never get another tenant till the grange is a ruin she answered sharply hearken hearken shoos cursing on em muttered joseph towards whom i had been steering he sat within earshot milking the cows by the light of a lantern which i seized unceremoniously and calling out that i would send it back on the morrow rushed to the nearest postern maister maister hes staling t lanthern shouted the ancient pursuing my retreat hey gnasher hey dog hey wolf holld him holld him on opening the little door two hairy monsters flew at my throat bearing me down and extinguishing the light while a mingled guffaw from heathcliff and hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation fortunately the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws and yawning and flourishing their tails than devouring me alive but they would suffer no resurrection and i was forced to lie till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me then hatless and trembling with wrath i ordered the miscreants to let me out on their peril to keep me one minute longer with several incoherent threats of retaliation that in their indefinite depth of virulency smacked of king lear the vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose and still heathcliff laughed and still i scolded i dont know what would have concluded the scene had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself and more benevolent than my entertainer this was zillah the stout housewife who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar she thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me and not daring to attack her master she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel well mr earnshaw she cried i wonder what youll have agait next are we going to murder folk on our very door stones i see this house will never do for me look at t poor lad hes fair choking wisht wisht you munnt go on so come in and ill cure that there now hold ye still with these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck and pulled me into the kitchen mr heathcliff followed his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness i was sick exceedingly and dizzy and faint and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof he told zillah to give me a glass of brandy and then passed on to the inner room while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament and having obeyed his orders whereby i was somewhat revived ushered me to bed
