in the course of time mr earnshaw began to fail he had been active and healthy yet his strength left him suddenly and when he was confined to the chimney corner he grew grievously irritable a nothing vexed him and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits this was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon or domineer over his favourite he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him seeming to have got into his head the notion that because he liked heathcliff all hated and longed to do him an ill turn it was a disadvantage to the lad for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master so we humoured his partiality and that humouring was rich nourishment to the childs pride and black tempers still it became in a manner necessary twice or thrice hindleys manifestation of scorn while his father was near roused the old man to a fury he seized his stick to strike him and shook with rage that he could not do it at last our curate we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little lintons and earnshaws and farming his bit of land himself advised that the young man should be sent to college and mr earnshaw agreed though with a heavy spirit for he said hindley was nought and would never thrive as where he wandered i hoped heartily we should have peace now it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed i fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements as he would have it that it did really you know sir it was in his sinking frame we might have got on tolerably notwithstanding but for two people miss cathy and joseph the servant you saw him i daresay up yonder he was and is yet most likely the wearisomest self righteous pharisee that ever ransacked a bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours by his knack of sermonising and pious discoursing he contrived to make a great impression on mr earnshaw and the more feeble the master became the more influence he gained he was relentless in worrying him about his souls concerns and about ruling his children rigidly he encouraged him to regard hindley as a reprobate and night after night he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against heathcliff and catherine always minding to flatter earnshaws weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter certainly she had ways with her such as i never saw a child take up before and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to bed we had not a minutes security that she wouldnt be in mischief her spirits were always at high water mark her tongue always going singing laughing and plaguing everybody who would not do the same a wild wicked slip she was but she had the bonniest eye the sweetest smile and lightest foot in the parish and after all i believe she meant no harm for when once she made you cry in good earnest it seldom happened that she would not keep you company and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her she was much too fond of heathcliff the greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him yet she got chided more than any of us on his account in play she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress using her hands freely and commanding her companions she did so to me but i would not bear slapping and ordering and so i let her know now mr earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children he had always been strict and grave with them and catherine on her part had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime his peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once and she defying us with her bold saucy look and her ready words turning josephs religious curses into ridicule baiting me and doing just what her father hated most showing how her pretended insolence which he thought real had more power over heathcliff than his kindness how the boy would do her bidding in anything and his only when it suited his own inclination after behaving as badly as possible all day she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night nay cathy the old man would say i cannot love thee thourt worse than thy brother go say thy prayers child and ask gods pardon i doubt thy mother and i must rue that we ever reared thee that made her cry at first and then being repulsed continually hardened her and she laughed if i told her to say she was sorry for her faults and beg to be forgiven but the hour came at last that ended mr earnshaws troubles on earth he died quietly in his chair one october evening seated by the fire side a high wind blustered round the house and roared in the chimney it sounded wild and stormy yet it was not cold and we were all together i a little removed from the hearth busy at my knitting and joseph reading his bible near the table for the servants generally sat in the house then after their work was done miss cathy had been sick and that made her still she leant against her fathers knee and heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap i remember the master before he fell into a doze stroking her bonny hair it pleased him rarely to see her gentle and saying why canst thou not always be a good lass cathy and she turned her face up to his and laughed and answered why cannot you always be a good man father but as soon as she saw him vexed again she kissed his hand and said she would sing him to sleep she began singing very low till his fingers dropped from hers and his head sank on his breast then i told her to hush and not stir for fear she should wake him we all kept as mute as mice a full half hour and should have done so longer only joseph having finished his chapter got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed he stepped forward and called him by name and touched his shoulder but he would not move so he took the candle and looked at him i thought there was something wrong as he set down the light and seizing the children each by an arm whispered them to frame upstairs and make little din they might pray alone that evening he had summut to do i shall bid father good night first said catherine putting her arms round his neck before we could hinder her the poor thing discovered her loss directly she screamed out oh hes dead heathcliff hes dead and they both set up a heart breaking cry i joined my wail to theirs loud and bitter but joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven he told me to put on my cloak and run to gimmerton for the doctor and the parson i could not guess the use that either would be of then however i went through wind and rain and brought one the doctor back with me the other said he would come in the morning leaving joseph to explain matters i ran to the childrens room their door was ajar i saw they had never lain down though it was past midnight but they were calmer and did not need me to console them the little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than i could have hit on no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did in their innocent talk and while i sobbed and listened i could not help wishing we were all there safe together
