1802 this september i was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north and on my journey to his abode i unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of gimmerton the ostler at a roadside public house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses when a cart of very green oats newly reaped passed by and he remarked yons frough gimmerton nah theyre allas three wick after other folk wi ther harvest gimmerton i repeated my residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy ah i know how far is it from this happen fourteen mile oer th hills and a rough road he answered a sudden impulse seized me to visit thrushcross grange it was scarcely noon and i conceived that i might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn besides i could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again having rested awhile i directed my servant to inquire the way to the village and with great fatigue to our beasts we managed the distance in some three hours i left him there and proceeded down the valley alone the grey church looked greyer and the lonely churchyard lonelier i distinguished a moor sheep cropping the short turf on the graves it was sweet warm weather too warm for travelling but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below had i seen it nearer august im sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes in winter nothing more dreary in summer nothing more divine than those glens shut in by hills and those bluff bold swells of heath i reached the grange before sunset and knocked for admittance but the family had retreated into the back premises i judged by one thin blue wreath curling from the kitchen chimney and they did not hear i rode into the court under the porch a girl of nine or ten sat knitting and an old woman reclined on the housesteps smoking a meditative pipe is mrs dean within i demanded of the dame mistress dean nay she answered she doesnt bide here shoos up at th heights are you the housekeeper then i continued eea aw keep th hause she replied well im mr lockwood the master are there any rooms to lodge me in i wonder i wish to stay all night t maister she cried in astonishment whet whoiver knew yah wur coming yah sud ha send word theys nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t place nowt there isnt she threw down her pipe and bustled in the girl followed and i entered too soon perceiving that her report was true and moreover that i had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition i bade her be composed i would go out for a walk and meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a sitting room for me to sup in and a bedroom to sleep in no sweeping and dusting only good fire and dry sheets were necessary she seemed willing to do her best though she thrust the hearth brush into the grates in mistake for the poker and malappropriated several other articles of her craft but i retired confiding in her energy for a resting place against my return wuthering heights was the goal of my proposed excursion an after thought brought me back when i had quitted the court all well at the heights i inquired of the woman eea fr owt ee knaw she answered skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders i would have asked why mrs dean had deserted the grange but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis so i turned away and made my exit rambling leisurely along with the glow of a sinking sun behind and the mild glory of a rising moon in front one fading and the other brightening as i quitted the park and climbed the stony by road branching off to mr heathcliffs dwelling before i arrived in sight of it all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west but i could see every pebble on the path and every blade of grass by that splendid moon i had neither to climb the gate nor to knock it yielded to my hand that is an improvement i thought and i noticed another by the aid of my nostrils a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit trees both doors and lattices were open and yet as is usually the case in a coal district a fine red fire illumined the chimney the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable but the house of wuthering heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows i could both see them and hear them talk before i entered and looked and listened in consequence being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy that grew as i lingered con trary said a voice as sweet as a silver bell that for the third time you dunce im not going to tell you again recollect or ill pull your hair contrary then answered another in deep but softened tones and now kiss me for minding so well no read it over first correctly without a single mistake the male speaker began to read he was a young man respectably dressed and seated at a table having a book before him his handsome features glowed with pleasure and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention its owner stood behind her light shining ringlets blending at intervals with his brown locks as she bent to superintend his studies and her face it was lucky he could not see her face or he would never have been so steady i could and i bit my lip in spite at having thrown away the chance i might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiting beauty the task was done not free from further blunders but the pupil claimed a reward and received at least five kisses which however he generously returned then they came to the door and from their conversation i judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors i supposed i should be condemned in hareton earnshaws heart if not by his mouth to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if i showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then and feeling very mean and malignant i skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen there was unobstructed admittance on that side also and at the door sat my old friend nelly dean sewing and singing a song which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance uttered in far from musical accents id rayther by th haulf hev em swearing i my lugs froh morn to neeght nor hearken ye hahsiver said the tenant of the kitchen in answer to an unheard speech of nellys its a blazing shame that i cannot oppen t blessed book but yah set up them glories to sattan and all t flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th warld oh yere a raight nowt and shoos another and that poor lad ll be lost atween ye poor lad he added with a groan hes witched im sartin ont oh lord judge em for theres norther law nor justice among wer rullers no or we should be sitting in flaming fagots i suppose retorted the singer but wisht old man and read your bible like a christian and never mind me this is fairy annies wedding a bonny tune it goes to a dance mrs dean was about to recommence when i advanced and recognising me directly she jumped to her feet crying why bless you mr lockwood how could you think of returning in this way alls shut up at thrushcross grange you should have given us notice ive arranged to be accommodated there for as long as i shall stay i answered i depart again to morrow and how are you transplanted here mrs dean tell me that zillah left and mr heathcliff wished me to come soon after you went to london and stay till you returned but step in pray have you walked from gimmerton this evening from the grange i replied and while they make me lodging room there i want to finish my business with your master because i dont think of having another opportunity in a hurry what business sir said nelly conducting me into the house hes gone out at present and wont return soon about the rent i answered oh then it is with mrs heathcliff you must settle she observed or rather with me she has not learnt to manage her affairs yet and i act for her theres nobody else i looked surprised ah you have not heard of heathcliffs death i see she continued heathcliff dead i exclaimed astonished how long ago three months since but sit down and let me take your hat and ill tell you all about it stop you have had nothing to eat have you i want nothing i have ordered supper at home you sit down too i never dreamt of his dying let me hear how it came to pass you say you dont expect them back for some time the young people no i have to scold them every evening for their late rambles but they dont care for me at least have a drink of our old ale it will do you good you seem weary she hastened to fetch it before i could refuse and i heard joseph asking whether it warnt a crying scandal that she should have followers at her time of life and then to get them jocks out o t maisters cellar he fair shaamed to bide still and see it she did not stay to retaliate but re entered in a minute bearing a reaming silver pint whose contents i lauded with becoming earnestness and afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of heathcliffs history he had a queer end as she expressed it * * * * * i was summoned to wuthering heights within a fortnight of your leaving us she said and i obeyed joyfully for catherines sake my first interview with her grieved and shocked me she had altered so much since our separation mr heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here he only told me he wanted me and he was tired of seeing catherine i must make the little parlour my sitting room and keep her with me it was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day she seemed pleased at this arrangement and by degrees i smuggled over a great number of books and other articles that had formed her amusement at the grange and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort the delusion did not last long catherine contented at first in a brief space grew irritable and restless for one thing she was forbidden to move out of the garden and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on for another in following the house i was forced to quit her frequently and she complained of loneliness she preferred quarrelling with joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude i did not mind their skirmishes but hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also when the master wanted to have the house to himself and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach or quietly joined in my occupations and shunned remarking or addressing him and though he was always as sullen and silent as possible after a while she changed her behaviour and became incapable of letting him alone talking at him commenting on his stupidity and idleness expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he lived how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire and dozing hes just like a dog is he not ellen she once observed or a cart horse he does his work eats his food and sleeps eternally what a blank dreary mind he must have do you ever dream hareton and if you do what is it about but you cant speak to me then she looked at him but he would neither open his mouth nor look again hes perhaps dreaming now she continued he twitched his shoulder as juno twitches hers ask him ellen mr hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs if you dont behave i said he had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist as if tempted to use it i know why hareton never speaks when i am in the kitchen she exclaimed on another occasion he is afraid i shall laugh at him ellen what do you think he began to teach himself to read once and because i laughed he burned his books and dropped it was he not a fool were not you naughty i said answer me that perhaps i was she went on but i did not expect him to be so silly hareton if i gave you a book would you take it now ill try she placed one she had been perusing on his hand he flung it off and muttered if she did not give over he would break her neck well i shall put it here she said in the table drawer and im going to bed then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it and departed but he would not come near it and so i informed her in the morning to her great disappointment i saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself she had done it effectually but her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury while i ironed or pursued other such stationary employments as i could not well do in the parlour she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me when hareton was there she generally paused in an interesting part and left the book lying about that she did repeatedly but he was as obstinate as a mule and instead of snatching at her bait in wet weather he took to smoking with joseph and they sat like automatons one on each side of the fire the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense as he would have called it the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it on fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions and catherine yawned and sighed and teased me to talk to her and ran off into the court or garden the moment i began and as a last resource cried and said she was tired of living her life was useless mr heathcliff who grew more and more disinclined to society had almost banished earnshaw from his apartment owing to an accident at the commencement of march he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen his gun burst while out on the hills by himself a splinter cut his arm and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home the consequence was that perforce he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity till he made it up again it suited catherine to have him there at any rate it made her hate her room upstairs more than ever and she would compel me to find out business below that she might accompany me on easter monday joseph went to gimmerton fair with some cattle and in the afternoon i was busy getting up linen in the kitchen earnshaw sat morose as usual at the chimney corner and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window panes varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs and whispered ejaculations and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin who steadfastly smoked and looked into the grate at a notice that i could do with her no longer intercepting my light she removed to the hearthstone i bestowed little attention on her proceedings but presently i heard her begin ive found out hareton that i want that im glad that i should like you to be my cousin now if you had not grown so cross to me and so rough hareton returned no answer hareton hareton hareton do you hear she continued get off wi ye he growled with uncompromising gruffness let me take that pipe she said cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth before he could attempt to recover it it was broken and behind the fire he swore at her and seized another stop she cried you must listen to me first and i cant speak while those clouds are floating in my face will you go to the devil he exclaimed ferociously and let me be no she persisted i wont i cant tell what to do to make you talk to me and you are determined not to understand when i call you stupid i dont mean anything i dont mean that i despise you come you shall take notice of me hareton you are my cousin and you shall own me i shall have naught to do wi you and your mucky pride and your damned mocking tricks he answered ill go to hell body and soul before i look sideways after you again side out o t gate now this minute catherine frowned and retreated to the window seat chewing her lip and endeavouring by humming an eccentric tune to conceal a growing tendency to sob you should be friends with your cousin mr hareton i interrupted since she repents of her sauciness it would do you a great deal of good it would make you another man to have her for a companion a companion he cried when she hates me and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon nay if it made me a king id not be scorned for seeking her good will any more it is not i who hate you it is you who hate me wept cathy no longer disguising her trouble you hate me as much as mr heathcliff does and more youre a damned liar began earnshaw why have i made him angry by taking your part then a hundred times and that when you sneered at and despised me and go on plaguing me and ill step in yonder and say you worried me out of the kitchen i didnt know you took my part she answered drying her eyes and i was miserable and bitter at everybody but now i thank you and beg you to forgive me what can i do besides she returned to the hearth and frankly extended her hand he blackened and scowled like a thunder cloud and kept his fists resolutely clenched and his gaze fixed on the ground catherine by instinct must have divined it was obdurate perversity and not dislike that prompted this dogged conduct for after remaining an instant undecided she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss the little rogue thought i had not seen her and drawing back she took her former station by the window quite demurely i shook my head reprovingly and then she blushed and whispered well what should i have done ellen he wouldnt shake hands and he wouldnt look i must show him some way that i like him that i want to be friends whether the kiss convinced hareton i cannot tell he was very careful for some minutes that his face should not be seen and when he did raise it he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper and having tied it with a bit of ribbon and addressed it to mr hareton earnshaw she desired me to be her ambassadress and convey the present to its destined recipient and tell him if hell take it ill come and teach him to read it right she said and if he refuse it ill go upstairs and never tease him again i carried it and repeated the message anxiously watched by my employer hareton would not open his fingers so i laid it on his knee he did not strike it off either i returned to my work catherine leaned her head and arms on the table till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being removed then she stole away and quietly seated herself beside her cousin he trembled and his face glowed all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him he could not summon courage at first to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look and her murmured petition say you forgive me hareton do you can make me so happy by speaking that little word he muttered something inaudible and youll be my friend added catherine interrogatively nay youll be ashamed of me every day of your life he answered and the more ashamed the more you know me and i cannot bide it so you wont be my friend she said smiling as sweet as honey and creeping close up i overheard no further distinguishable talk but on looking round again i perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book that i did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides and the enemies were thenceforth sworn allies the work they studied was full of costly pictures and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till joseph came home he poor man was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of catherine seated on the same bench with hareton earnshaw leaning her hand on his shoulder and confounded at his favourites endurance of her proximity it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night his emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew as he solemnly spread his large bible on the table and overlaid it with dirty bank notes from his pocket book the produce of the days transactions at length he summoned hareton from his seat tak these in to t maister lad he said and bide there is gang up to my own rahm this hoiles neither mensful nor seemly for us we mun side out and seearch another come catherine i said we must side out too ive done my ironing are you ready to go it is not eight oclock she answered rising unwillingly hareton ill leave this book upon the chimney piece and ill bring some more to morrow ony books that yah leave i shall tak into th hahse said joseph and itll be mitch if yah find em agean soa yah may plase yerseln cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers and smiling as she passed hareton went singing upstairs lighter of heart i venture to say than ever she had been under that roof before except perhaps during her earliest visits to linton the intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly though it encountered temporary interruptions earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish and my young lady was no philosopher and no paragon of patience but both their minds tending to the same point one loving and desiring to esteem and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed they contrived in the end to reach it you see mr lockwood it was easy enough to win mrs heathcliffs heart but now im glad you did not try the crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two i shall envy no one on their wedding day there wont be a happier woman than myself in england
