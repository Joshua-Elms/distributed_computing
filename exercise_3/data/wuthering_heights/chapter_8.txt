on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says shes been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and shell be dead before winter you must come home directly youre to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man shes out of her head for joy its such a beauty if i were her im certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up when the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw its a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we shouldnt keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her dont take on and fret about it too much it cant be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass and what did the master answer i inquired i think he swore but i didnt mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for hindleys sake he had room in his heart only for two idols his wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i couldnt conceive how he would bear the loss when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says shes damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right shell be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that ill come if shell promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she must tell her mr kenneth says she must be quiet i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily i hardly spoke a word ellen and there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i wont speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he neednt put him to further expense by attending her he retorted i know you need not shes well she does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up to morrow a fit of coughing took her a very slight one he raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his foster sister and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove the masters bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar lintons visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the country side she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his wifes on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a soft featured face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw a very agreeable portrait i observed to the house keeper is it like yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of earnshaws reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her ive had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds ill natured but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and to confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his childhoods sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the before named occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her brothers absence and was then preparing to receive him cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere no it is raining she answered why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy ill not work any more to day ill stay with you oh but joseph will tell she suggested youd better go joseph is loading lime on the further side of penistone crags it will take him till dark and hell never know so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted brows she found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a minutes silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted dont turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours im on the point sometimes of complaining that they but ill not that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands youve combed my hair quite out of curl thats enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff nothing only look at the almanack on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and continued the crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see ive marked every day yes very foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that to show that i do take notice said heathcliff and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation its no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered her companion rose up but he hadnt time to express his feelings further for a horses feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do thats less gruff than we talk here and softer im not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits linton chose to pay she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants dont commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are its a good opportunity now that master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence im sure mr edgar will excuse me i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff im sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm ive said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss thats a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and im not going to bear it i didnt touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze whats that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip thats right i said to myself take warning and begone its a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door he swerved aside and attempted to pass you must not go she exclaimed energetically i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper i should be miserable all night and i wont be miserable for you can i stay after you have struck me asked linton catherine was mute youve made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued ill not come here again her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle and you told a deliberate untruth he said i didnt she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you please get away and now ill cry ill cry myself sick she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out as bad as any marred child youd better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten ah i thought there will be no saving him hes doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers intelligence of mr hindleys arrival drove linton speedily to his horse and catherine to her chamber i went to hide little hareton and to take the shot out of the masters fowling piece which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his notice too much and i had hit upon the plan of removing it that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun
