he entered vociferating oaths dreadful to hear and caught me in the act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beasts fondness or his madmans rage for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death and in the other of being flung into the fire or dashed against the wall and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever i chose to put him there ive found it out at last cried hindley pulling me back by the skin of my neck like a dog by heaven and hell youve sworn between you to murder that child i know how it is now that he is always out of my way but with the help of satan i shall make you swallow the carving knife nelly you neednt laugh for ive just crammed kenneth head downmost in the black horse marsh and two is the same as one and i want to kill some of you i shall have no rest till i do but i dont like the carving knife mr hindley i answered it has been cutting red herrings id rather be shot if you please youd rather be damned he said and so you shall no law in england can hinder a man from keeping his house decent and mines abominable open your mouth he held the knife in his hand and pushed its point between my teeth but for my part i was never much afraid of his vagaries i spat out and affirmed it tasted detestably i would not take it on any account oh said he releasing me i see that hideous little villain is not hareton i beg your pardon nell if it be he deserves flaying alive for not running to welcome me and for screaming as if i were a goblin unnatural cub come hither ill teach thee to impose on a good hearted deluded father now dont you think the lad would be handsomer cropped it makes a dog fiercer and i love something fierce get me a scissors something fierce and trim besides its infernal affectation devilish conceit it is to cherish our ears were asses enough without them hush child hush well then it is my darling wisht dry thy eyes theres a joy kiss me what it wont kiss me hareton damn thee kiss me by god as if i would rear such a monster as sure as im living ill break the brats neck poor hareton was squalling and kicking in his fathers arms with all his might and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and lifted him over the banister i cried out that he would frighten the child into fits and ran to rescue him as i reached them hindley leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below almost forgetting what he had in his hands who is that he asked hearing some one approaching the stairs foot i leant forward also for the purpose of signing to heathcliff whose step i recognised not to come further and at the instant when my eye quitted hareton he gave a sudden spring delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him and fell there was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw that the little wretch was safe heathcliff arrived underneath just at the critical moment by a natural impulse he arrested his descent and setting him on his feet looked up to discover the author of the accident a miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand pounds could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the figure of mr earnshaw above it expressed plainer than words could do the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge had it been dark i daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by smashing haretons skull on the steps but we witnessed his salvation and i was presently below with my precious charge pressed to my heart hindley descended more leisurely sobered and abashed it is your fault ellen he said you should have kept him out of sight you should have taken him from me is he injured anywhere injured i cried angrily if he is not killed hell be an idiot oh i wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him youre worse than a heathen treating your own flesh and blood in that manner he attempted to touch the child who on finding himself with me sobbed off his terror directly at the first finger his father laid on him however he shrieked again louder than before and struggled as if he would go into convulsions you shall not meddle with him i continued he hates you they all hate you thats the truth a happy family you have and a pretty state youre come to i shall come to a prettier yet nelly laughed the misguided man recovering his hardness at present convey yourself and him away and hark you heathcliff clear you too quite from my reach and hearing i wouldnt murder you to night unless perhaps i set the house on fire but thats as my fancy goes while saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser and poured some into a tumbler nay dont i entreated mr hindley do take warning have mercy on this unfortunate boy if you care nothing for yourself any one will do better for him than i shall he answered have mercy on your own soul i said endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand not i on the contrary i shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its maker exclaimed the blasphemer heres to its hearty damnation he drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go terminating his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember its a pity he cannot kill himself with drink observed heathcliff muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut hes doing his very utmost but his constitution defies him mr kenneth says he would wager his mare that hell outlive any man on this side gimmerton and go to the grave a hoary sinner unless some happy chance out of the common course befall him i went into the kitchen and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep heathcliff as i thought walked through to the barn it turned out afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle when he flung himself on a bench by the wall removed from the fire and remained silent i was rocking hareton on my knee and humming a song that began it was far in the night and the bairnies grat the mither beneath the mools heard that when miss cathy who had listened to the hubbub from her room put her head in and whispered are you alone nelly yes miss i replied she entered and approached the hearth i supposing she was going to say something looked up the expression of her face seemed disturbed and anxious her lips were half asunder as if she meant to speak and she drew a breath but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence i resumed my song not having forgotten her recent behaviour wheres heathcliff she said interrupting me about his work in the stable was my answer he did not contradict me perhaps he had fallen into a doze there followed another long pause during which i perceived a drop or two trickle from catherines cheek to the flags is she sorry for her shameful conduct i asked myself that will be a novelty but she may come to the point as she will i shant help her no she felt small trouble regarding any subject save her own concerns oh dear she cried at last im very unhappy a pity observed i youre hard to please so many friends and so few cares and cant make yourself content nelly will you keep a secret for me she pursued kneeling down by me and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper even when one has all the right in the world to indulge it is it worth keeping i inquired less sulkily yes and it worries me and i must let it out i want to know what i should do to day edgar linton has asked me to marry him and ive given him an answer now before i tell you whether it was a consent or denial you tell me which it ought to have been really miss catherine how can i know i replied to be sure considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon i might say it would be wise to refuse him since he asked you after that he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool if you talk so i wont tell you any more she returned peevishly rising to her feet i accepted him nelly be quick and say whether i was wrong you accepted him then what good is it discussing the matter you have pledged your word and cannot retract but say whether i should have done so do she exclaimed in an irritated tone chafing her hands together and frowning there are many things to be considered before that question can be answered properly i said sententiously first and foremost do you love mr edgar who can help it of course i do she answered then i put her through the following catechism for a girl of twenty two it was not injudicious why do you love him miss cathy nonsense i do thats sufficient by no means you must say why well because he is handsome and pleasant to be with bad was my commentary and because he is young and cheerful bad still and because he loves me indifferent coming there and he will be rich and i shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood and i shall be proud of having such a husband worst of all and now say how you love him as everybody loves youre silly nelly not at all answer i love the ground under his feet and the air over his head and everything he touches and every word he says i love all his looks and all his actions and him entirely and altogether there now and why nay you are making a jest of it it is exceedingly ill natured its no jest to me said the young lady scowling and turning her face to the fire im very far from jesting miss catherine i replied you love mr edgar because he is handsome and young and cheerful and rich and loves you the last however goes for nothing you would love him without that probably and with it you wouldnt unless he possessed the four former attractions no to be sure not i should only pity him hate him perhaps if he were ugly and a clown but there are several other handsome rich young men in the world handsomer possibly and richer than he is what should hinder you from loving them if there be any they are out of my way ive seen none like edgar you may see some and he wont always be handsome and young and may not always be rich he is now and i have only to do with the present i wish you would speak rationally well that settles it if you have only to do with the present marry mr linton i dont want your permission for that i shall marry him and yet you have not told me whether im right perfectly right if people be right to marry only for the present and now let us hear what you are unhappy about your brother will be pleased the old lady and gentleman will not object i think you will escape from a disorderly comfortless home into a wealthy respectable one and you love edgar and edgar loves you all seems smooth and easy where is the obstacle here and here replied catherine striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast in whichever place the soul lives in my soul and in my heart im convinced im wrong thats very strange i cannot make it out its my secret but if you will not mock at me ill explain it i cant do it distinctly but ill give you a feeling of how i feel she seated herself by me again her countenance grew sadder and graver and her clasped hands trembled nelly do you never dream queer dreams she said suddenly after some minutes reflection yes now and then i answered and so do i ive dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas theyve gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the colour of my mind and this is one im going to tell it but take care not to smile at any part of it oh dont miss catherine i cried were dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us come come be merry and like yourself look at little hareton hes dreaming nothing dreary how sweetly he smiles in his sleep yes and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude you remember him i daresay when he was just such another as that chubby thing nearly as young and innocent however nelly i shall oblige you to listen its not long and ive no power to be merry to night i wont hear it i wont hear it i repeated hastily i was superstitious about dreams then and am still and catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect that made me dread something from which i might shape a prophecy and foresee a fearful catastrophe she was vexed but she did not proceed apparently taking up another subject she recommenced in a short time if i were in heaven nelly i should be extremely miserable because you are not fit to go there i answered all sinners would be miserable in heaven but it is not for that i dreamt once that i was there i tell you i wont hearken to your dreams miss catherine ill go to bed i interrupted again she laughed and held me down for i made a motion to leave my chair this is nothing cried she i was only going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home and i broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of wuthering heights where i woke sobbing for joy that will do to explain my secret as well as the other ive no more business to marry edgar linton than i have to be in heaven and if the wicked man in there had not brought heathcliff so low i shouldnt have thought of it it would degrade me to marry heathcliff now so he shall never know how i love him and that not because hes handsome nelly but because hes more myself than i am whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same and lintons is as different as a moonbeam from lightning or frost from fire ere this speech ended i became sensible of heathcliffs presence having noticed a slight movement i turned my head and saw him rise from the bench and steal out noiselessly he had listened till he heard catherine say it would degrade her to marry him and then he stayed to hear no further my companion sitting on the ground was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure but i started and bade her hush why she asked gazing nervously round joseph is here i answered catching opportunely the roll of his cartwheels up the road and heathcliff will come in with him im not sure whether he were not at the door this moment oh he couldnt overhear me at the door said she give me hareton while you get the supper and when it is ready ask me to sup with you i want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience and be convinced that heathcliff has no notion of these things he has not has he he does not know what being in love is i see no reason that he should not know as well as you i returned and if you are his choice hell be the most unfortunate creature that ever was born as soon as you become mrs linton he loses friend and love and all have you considered how youll bear the separation and how hell bear to be quite deserted in the world because miss catherine he quite deserted we separated she exclaimed with an accent of indignation who is to separate us pray theyll meet the fate of milo not as long as i live ellen for no mortal creature every linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before i could consent to forsake heathcliff oh thats not what i intend thats not what i mean i shouldnt be mrs linton were such a price demanded hell be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime edgar must shake off his antipathy and tolerate him at least he will when he learns my true feelings towards him nelly i see now you think me a selfish wretch but did it never strike you that if heathcliff and i married we should be beggars whereas if i marry linton i can aid heathcliff to rise and place him out of my brothers power with your husbands money miss catherine i asked youll find him not so pliable as you calculate upon and though im hardly a judge i think thats the worst motive youve given yet for being the wife of young linton it is not retorted she it is the best the others were the satisfaction of my whims and for edgars sake too to satisfy him this is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to edgar and myself i cannot express it but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you what were the use of my creation if i were entirely contained here my great miseries in this world have been heathcliffs miseries and i watched and felt each from the beginning my great thought in living is himself if all else perished and he remained i should still continue to be and if all else remained and he were annihilated the universe would turn to a mighty stranger i should not seem a part of it my love for linton is like the foliage in the woods time will change it im well aware as winter changes the trees my love for heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight but necessary nelly i am heathcliff hes always always in my mind not as a pleasure any more than i am always a pleasure to myself but as my own being so dont talk of our separation again it is impracticable and she paused and hid her face in the folds of my gown but i jerked it forcibly away i was out of patience with her folly if i can make any sense of your nonsense miss i said it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying or else that you are a wicked unprincipled girl but trouble me with no more secrets ill not promise to keep them youll keep that she asked eagerly no ill not promise i repeated she was about to insist when the entrance of joseph finished our conversation and catherine removed her seat to a corner and nursed hareton while i made the supper after it was cooked my fellow servant and i began to quarrel who should carry some to mr hindley and we didnt settle it till all was nearly cold then we came to the agreement that we would let him ask if he wanted any for we feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time alone and how isnt that nowt comed in fro th field be this time what is he about girt idle seeght demanded the old man looking round for heathcliff ill call him i replied hes in the barn ive no doubt i went and called but got no answer on returning i whispered to catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said i was sure and told how i saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brothers conduct regarding him she jumped up in a fine fright flung hareton on to the settle and ran to seek for her friend herself not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried or how her talk would have affected him she was absent such a while that joseph proposed we should wait no longer he cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing they were ill eneugh for ony fahl manners he affirmed and on their behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual quarter of an hours supplication before meat and would have tacked another to the end of the grace had not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road and wherever heathcliff had rambled find and make him re enter directly i want to speak to him and i must before i go upstairs she said and the gate is open he is somewhere out of hearing for he would not reply though i shouted at the top of the fold as loud as i could joseph objected at first she was too much in earnest however to suffer contradiction and at last he placed his hat on his head and walked grumbling forth meantime catherine paced up and down the floor exclaiming i wonder where he is i wonder where he can be what did i say nelly ive forgotten was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon dear tell me what ive said to grieve him i do wish hed come i do wish he would what a noise for nothing i cried though rather uneasy myself what a trifle scares you its surely no great cause of alarm that heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hay loft ill engage hes lurking there see if i dont ferret him out i departed to renew my search its result was disappointment and josephs quest ended in the same yon lad gets war und war observed he on re entering hes left th gate at t full swing and misss pony has trodden dahn two rigs o corn and plottered through raight oer into t meadow hahsomdiver t maister ull play t devil to morn and hell do weel hes patience itsseln wi sich careless offald craters patience itsseln he is bud hell not be soa allus yahs see all on ye yah munnt drive him out of his heead for nowt have you found heathcliff you ass interrupted catherine have you been looking for him as i ordered i sud

happen hell be less hard o hearing wi ye it was a very dark evening for summer the clouds appeared inclined to thunder and i said we had better all sit down the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble however catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity she kept wandering to and fro from the gate to the door in a state of agitation which permitted no repose and at length took up a permanent situation on one side of the wall near the road where heedless of my expostulations and the growling thunder and the great drops that began to plash around her she remained calling at intervals and then listening and then crying outright she beat hareton or any child at a good passionate fit of crying about midnight while we still sat up the storm came rattling over the heights in full fury there was a violent wind as well as thunder and either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building a huge bough fell across the roof and knocked down a portion of the east chimney stack sending a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen fire we thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us and joseph swung on to his knees beseeching the lord to remember the patriarchs noah and lot and as in former times spare the righteous though he smote the ungodly i felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on us also the jonah in my mind was mr earnshaw and i shook the handle of his den that i might ascertain if he were yet living he replied audibly enough in a fashion which made my companion vociferate more clamorously than before that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master but the uproar passed away in twenty minutes leaving us all unharmed excepting cathy who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes she came in and lay down on the settle all soaked as she was turning her face to the back and putting her hands before it well miss i exclaimed touching her shoulder you are not bent on getting your death are you do you know what oclock it is half past twelve come come to bed theres no use waiting any longer on that foolish boy hell be gone to gimmerton and hell stay there now he guesses we shouldnt wait for him till this late hour at least he guesses that only mr hindley would be up and hed rather avoid having the door opened by the master nay nay hes noan at gimmerton said joseph is niver wonder but hes at t bothom of a bog hoile this visitation wornt for nowt and i wod hev ye to look out miss yah muh be t next thank hivin for all all warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen and piked out fro th rubbidge yah knaw whet t scripture ses and he began quoting several texts referring us to chapters and verses where we might find them i having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things left him preaching and her shivering and betook myself to bed with little hareton who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping round him i heard joseph read on a while afterwards then i distinguished his slow step on the ladder and then i dropped asleep coming down somewhat later than usual i saw by the sunbeams piercing the chinks of the shutters miss catherine still seated near the fireplace the house door was ajar too light entered from its unclosed windows hindley had come out and stood on the kitchen hearth haggard and drowsy what ails you cathy he was saying when i entered you look as dismal as a drowned whelp why are you so damp and pale child ive been wet she answered reluctantly and im cold thats all oh she is naughty i cried perceiving the master to be tolerably sober she got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening and there she has sat the night through and i couldnt prevail on her to stir mr earnshaw stared at us in surprise the night through he repeated what kept her up not fear of the thunder surely that was over hours since neither of us wished to mention heathcliffs absence as long as we could conceal it so i replied i didnt know how she took it into her head to sit up and she said nothing the morning was fresh and cool i threw back the lattice and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden but catherine called peevishly to me ellen shut the window im starving and her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished embers shes ill said hindley taking her wrist i suppose thats the reason she would not go to bed damn it i dont want to be troubled with more sickness here what took you into the rain running after t lads as usuald croaked joseph catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue if i war yah maister id just slam t boards i their faces all on em gentle and simple never a day ut yahre off but yon cat o linton comes sneaking hither and miss nelly shoos a fine lass shoo sits watching for ye i t kitchen and as yahre in at one door hes out at tother and then wer grand lady goes a courting of her side its bonny behaviour lurking amang t fields after twelve o t night wi that fahl flaysome divil of a gipsy heathcliff they think im blind but im noan nowt ut t soart i seed young linton boath coming and going and i seed yah directing his discourse to me yah gooid fur nowt slattenly witch nip up and bolt into th house t minute yah heard t maisters horse fit clatter up t road silence eavesdropper cried catherine none of your insolence before me edgar linton came yesterday by chance hindley and it was i who told him to be off because i knew you would not like to have met him as you were you lie cathy no doubt answered her brother and you are a confounded simpleton but never mind linton at present tell me were you not with heathcliff last night speak the truth now you need not be afraid of harming him though i hate him as much as ever he did me a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck to prevent it i shall send him about his business this very morning and after hes gone id advise you all to look sharp i shall only have the more humour for you i never saw heathcliff last night answered catherine beginning to sob bitterly and if you do turn him out of doors ill go with him but perhaps youll never have an opportunity perhaps hes gone here she burst into uncontrollable grief and the remainder of her words were inarticulate hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse and bade her get to her room immediately or she shouldnt cry for nothing i obliged her to obey and i shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber it terrified me i thought she was going mad and i begged joseph to run for the doctor it proved the commencement of delirium mr kenneth as soon as he saw her pronounced her dangerously ill she had a fever he bled her and he told me to let her live on whey and water gruel and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of the window and then he left for he had enough to do in the parish where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and cottage though i cannot say i made a gentle nurse and joseph and the master were no better and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could be she weathered it through old mrs linton paid us several visits to be sure and set things to rights and scolded and ordered us all and when catherine was convalescent she insisted on conveying her to thrushcross grange for which deliverance we were very grateful but the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness she and her husband both took the fever and died within a few days of each other our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate and haughtier than ever heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the thunder storm and one day i had the misfortune when she had provoked me exceedingly to lay the blame of his disappearance on her where indeed it belonged as she well knew from that period for several months she ceased to hold any communication with me save in the relation of a mere servant joseph fell under a ban also he would speak his mind and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl and she esteemed herself a woman and our mistress and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration then the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much she ought to have her own way and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her from mr earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof and tutored by kenneth and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper he was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices not from affection but from pride he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family by an alliance with the lintons and as long as she let him alone she might trample on us like slaves for aught he cared edgar linton as multitudes have been before and will be after him was infatuated and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to gimmerton chapel three years subsequent to his fathers death much against my inclination i was persuaded to leave wuthering heights and accompany her here little hareton was nearly five years old and i had just begun to teach him his letters we made a sad parting but catherines tears were more powerful than ours when i refused to go and when she found her entreaties did not move me she went lamenting to her husband and brother the former offered me munificent wages the latter ordered me to pack up he wanted no women in the house he said now that there was no mistress and as to hareton the curate should take him in hand by and by and so i had but one choice left to do as i was ordered i told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run to ruin a little faster i kissed hareton said good by and since then he has been a stranger and its very queer to think it but ive no doubt he has completely forgotten all about ellen dean and that he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him * * * * * at this point of the housekeepers story she chanced to glance towards the time piece over the chimney and was in amazement on seeing the minute hand measure half past one she would not hear of staying a second longer in truth i felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative myself and now that she is vanished to her rest and i have meditated for another hour or two i shall summon courage to go also in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs
