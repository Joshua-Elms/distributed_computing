that friday made the last of our fine days for a month in the evening the weather broke the wind shifted from south to north east and brought rain first and then sleet and snow on the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts the larks were silent the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened and dreary and chill and dismal that morrow did creep over my master kept his room i took possession of the lonely parlour converting it into a nursery and there i was sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee rocking it to and fro and watching meanwhile the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window when the door opened and some person entered out of breath and laughing my anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute i supposed it one of the maids and i cried have done how dare you show your giddiness here what would mr linton say if he heard you excuse me answered a familiar voice but i know edgar is in bed and i cannot stop myself with that the speaker came forward to the fire panting and holding her hand to her side i have run the whole way from wuthering heights she continued after a pause except where ive flown i couldnt count the number of falls ive had oh im aching all over dont be alarmed there shall be an explanation as soon as i can give it only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to gimmerton and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe the intruder was mrs heathcliff she certainly seemed in no laughing predicament her hair streamed on her shoulders dripping with snow and water she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore befitting her age more than her position a low frock with short sleeves and nothing on either head or neck the frock was of light silk and clung to her with wet and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers add to this a deep cut under one ear which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely a white face scratched and bruised and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when i had had leisure to examine her my dear young lady i exclaimed ill stir nowhere and hear nothing till you have removed every article of your clothes and put on dry things and certainly you shall not go to gimmerton to night so it is needless to order the carriage certainly i shall she said walking or riding yet ive no objection to dress myself decently and ah see how it flows down my neck now the fire does make it smart she insisted on my fulfilling her directions before she would let me touch her and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire did i obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments now ellen she said when my task was finished and she was seated in an easy chair on the hearth with a cup of tea before her you sit down opposite me and put poor catherines baby away i dont like to see it you mustnt think i care little for catherine because i behaved so foolishly on entering ive cried too bitterly yes more than any one else has reason to cry we parted unreconciled you remember and i shant forgive myself but for all that i was not going to sympathise with him the brute beast oh give me the poker this is the last thing of his i have about me she slipped the gold ring from her third finger and threw it on the floor ill smash it she continued striking it with childish spite and then ill burn it and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals there he shall buy another if he gets me back again hed be capable of coming to seek me to tease edgar i dare not stay lest that notion should possess his wicked head and besides edgar has not been kind has he and i wont come suing for his assistance nor will i bring him into more trouble necessity compelled me to seek shelter here though if i had not learned he was out of the way id have halted at the kitchen washed my face warmed myself got you to bring what i wanted and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed of that incarnate goblin ah he was in such a fury if he had caught me its a pity earnshaw is not his match in strength i wouldnt have run till id seen him all but demolished had hindley been able to do it well dont talk so fast miss i interrupted youll disorder the handkerchief i have tied round your face and make the cut bleed again drink your tea and take breath and give over laughing laughter is sadly out of place under this roof and in your condition an undeniable truth she replied listen to that child it maintains a constant wail send it out of my hearing for an hour i shant stay any longer i rang the bell and committed it to a servants care and then i inquired what had urged her to escape from wuthering heights in such an unlikely plight and where she meant to go as she refused remaining with us i ought and i wished to remain answered she to cheer edgar and take care of the baby for two things and because the grange is my right home but i tell you he wouldnt let me do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry could bear to think that we were tranquil and not resolve on poisoning our comfort now i have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within ear shot or eyesight i notice when i enter his presence the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes i have to feel that sentiment for him and partly from original aversion it is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over england supposing i contrived a clear escape and therefore i must get quite away ive recovered from my first desire to be killed by him id rather hed kill himself he has extinguished my love effectually and so im at my ease i can recollect yet how i loved him and can dimly imagine that i could still be loving him if no no even if he had doted on me the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly knowing him so well monster would that he could be blotted out of creation and out of my memory hush hush hes a human being i said be more charitable there are worse men than he is yet hes not a human being she retorted and he has no claim on my charity i gave him my heart and he took and pinched it to death and flung it back to me people feel with their hearts ellen and since he has destroyed mine i have not power to feel for him and i would not though he groaned from this to his dying day and wept tears of blood for catherine no indeed indeed i wouldnt and here isabella began to cry but immediately dashing the water from her lashes she recommenced you asked what has driven me to flight at last i was compelled to attempt it because i had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head he was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of and proceeded to murderous violence i experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of self preservation so i fairly broke free and if ever i come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge yesterday you know mr earnshaw should have been at the funeral he kept himself sober for the purpose tolerably sober not going to bed mad at six oclock and getting up drunk at twelve consequently he rose in suicidal low spirits as fit for the church as for a dance and instead he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls heathcliff i shudder to name him has been a stranger in the house from last sunday till to day whether the angels have fed him or his kin beneath i cannot tell but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week he has just come home at dawn and gone upstairs to his chamber locking himself in as if anybody dreamt of coveting his company there he has continued praying like a methodist only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes and god when addressed was curiously confounded with his own black father after concluding these precious orisons and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throat he would be off again always straight down to the grange i wonder edgar did not send for a constable and give him into custody for me grieved as i was about catherine it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday i recovered spirits sufficient to hear josephs eternal lectures without weeping and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly you wouldnt think that i should cry at anything joseph could say but he and hareton are detestable companions id rather sit with hindley and hear his awful talk than with t little maister and his staunch supporter that odious old man when heathcliff is in im often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers when he is not as was the case this week i establish a table and chair at one corner of the house fire and never mind how mr earnshaw may occupy himself and he does not interfere with my arrangements he is quieter now than he used to be if no one provokes him more sullen and depressed and less furious joseph affirms hes sure hes an altered man that the lord has touched his heart and he is saved so as by fire im puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change but it is not my business yester evening i sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards twelve it seemed so dismal to go upstairs with the wild snow blowing outside and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard and the new made grave i dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place hindley sat opposite his head leant on his hand perhaps meditating on the same subject he had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours there was no sound through the house but the moaning wind which shook the windows every now and then the faint crackling of the coals and the click of my snuffers as i removed at intervals the long wick of the candle hareton and joseph were probably fast asleep in bed it was very very sad and while i read i sighed for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world never to be restored the doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual owing i suppose to the sudden storm that entrance was fastened and we heard him coming round to get in by the other i rose with an irrepressible expression of what i felt on my lips which induced my companion who had been staring towards the door to turn and look at me ill keep him out five minutes he exclaimed you wont object no you may keep him out the whole night for me i answered do put the key in the lock and draw the bolts earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table leaning over it and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his as he both looked and felt like an assassin he couldnt exactly find that but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak you and i he said have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder if we were neither of us cowards we might combine to discharge it are you as soft as your brother are you willing to endure to the last and not once attempt a repayment im weary of enduring now i replied and id be glad of a retaliation that wouldnt recoil on myself but treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence cried hindley mrs heathcliff ill ask you to do nothing but sit still and be dumb tell me now can you im sure you would have as much pleasure as i in witnessing the conclusion of the fiends existence hell be your death unless you overreach him and hell be my ruin damn the hellish villain he knocks at the door as if he were master here already promise to hold your tongue and before that clock strikes it wants three minutes of one youre a free woman he took the implements which i described to you in my letter from his breast and would have turned down the candle i snatched it away however and seized his arm ill not hold my tongue i said you mustnt touch him let the door remain shut and be quiet no ive formed my resolution and by god ill execute it cried the desperate being ill do you a kindness in spite of yourself and hareton justice and you neednt trouble your head to screen me catherine is gone nobody alive would regret me or be ashamed though i cut my throat this minute and its time to make an end i might as well have struggled with a bear or reasoned with a lunatic the only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him youd better seek shelter somewhere else to night i exclaimed in rather a triumphant tone mr earnshaw has a mind to shoot you if you persist in endeavouring to enter youd better open the door you he answered addressing me by some elegant term that i dont care to repeat i shall not meddle in the matter i retorted again come in and get shot if you please ive done my duty with that i shut the window and returned to my place by the fire having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him earnshaw swore passionately at me affirming that i loved the villain yet and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit i evinced and i in my secret heart and conscience never reproached me thought what a blessing it would be for him should heathcliff put him out of misery and what a blessing for me should he send heathcliff to his right abode as i sat nursing these reflections the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual and his black countenance looked blightingly through the stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow and i smiled exulting in my fancied security his hair and clothes were whitened with snow and his sharp cannibal teeth revealed by cold and wrath gleamed through the dark isabella let me in or ill make you repent he girned as joseph calls it i cannot commit murder i replied mr hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded pistol let me in by the kitchen door he said hindley will be there before me i answered and thats a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow we were left at peace in our beds as long as the summer moon shone but the moment a blast of winter returns you must run for shelter heathcliff if i were you id go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog the world is surely not worth living in now is it you had distinctly impressed on me the idea that catherine was the whole joy of your life i cant imagine how you think of surviving her loss hes there is he exclaimed my companion rushing to the gap if i can get my arm out i can hit him im afraid ellen youll set me down as really wicked but you dont know all so dont judge i wouldnt have aided or abetted an attempt on even his life for anything wish that he were dead i must and therefore i was fearfully disappointed and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech when he flung himself on earnshaws weapon and wrenched it from his grasp the charge exploded and the knife in springing back closed into its owners wrist heathcliff pulled it away by main force slitting up the flesh as it passed on and thrust it dripping into his pocket he then took a stone struck down the division between two windows and sprang in his adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow of blood that gushed from an artery or a large vein the ruffian kicked and trampled on him and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags holding me with one hand meantime to prevent me summoning joseph he exerted preterhuman self denial in abstaining from finishing him completely but getting out of breath he finally desisted and dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle there he tore off the sleeve of earnshaws coat and bound up the wound with brutal roughness spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before being at liberty i lost no time in seeking the old servant who having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale hurried below gasping as he descended the steps two at once what is ther to do now what is ther to do now theres this to do thundered heathcliff that your masters mad and should he last another month ill have him to an asylum and how the devil did you come to fasten me out you toothless hound dont stand muttering and mumbling there come im not going to nurse him wash that stuff away and mind the sparks of your candle it is more than half brandy and so yeve been murthering on him exclaimed joseph lifting his hands and eyes in horror if iver i seed a seeght loike this may the lord heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood and flung a towel to him but instead of proceeding to dry it up he joined his hands and began a prayer which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology i was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing in fact i was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows oh i forgot you said the tyrant you shall do that down with you and you conspire with him against me do you viper there that is work fit for you he shook me till my teeth rattled and pitched me beside joseph who steadily concluded his supplications and then rose vowing he would set off for the grange directly mr linton was a magistrate and though he had fifty wives dead he should inquire into this he was so obstinate in his resolution that heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place standing over me heaving with malevolence as i reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions it required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that heathcliff was not the aggressor especially with my hardly wrung replies however mr earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness heathcliff aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible called him deliriously intoxicated and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further but advised him to get to bed to my joy he left us after giving this judicious counsel and hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone i departed to my own room marvelling that i had escaped so easily this morning when i came down about half an hour before noon mr earnshaw was sitting by the fire deadly sick his evil genius almost as gaunt and ghastly leant against the chimney neither appeared inclined to dine and having waited till all was cold on the table i commenced alone nothing hindered me from eating heartily and i experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority as at intervals i cast a look towards my silent companions and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me after i had done i ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire going round earnshaws seat and kneeling in the corner beside him heathcliff did not glance my way and i gazed up and contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone his forehead that i once thought so manly and that i now think so diabolical was shaded with a heavy cloud his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness and weeping perhaps for the lashes were wet then his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness had it been another i would have covered my face in the presence of such grief in his case i was gratified and ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy i couldnt miss this chance of sticking in a dart his weakness was the only time when i could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong fie fie miss i interrupted one might suppose you had never opened a bible in your life if god afflict your enemies surely that ought to suffice you it is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to his in general ill allow that it would be ellen she continued but what misery laid on heathcliff could content me unless i have a hand in it id rather he suffered less if i might cause his sufferings and he might know that i was the cause oh i owe him so much on only one condition can i hope to forgive him it is if i may take an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth for every wrench of agony return a wrench reduce him to my level as he was the first to injure make him the first to implore pardon and then why then ellen i might show you some generosity but it is utterly impossible i can ever be revenged and therefore i cannot forgive him hindley wanted some water and i handed him a glass and asked him how he was not as ill as i wish he replied but leaving out my arm every inch of me is as sore as if i had been fighting with a legion of imps yes no wonder was my next remark catherine used to boast that she stood between you and bodily harm she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her its well people dont really rise from their grave or last night she might have witnessed a repulsive scene are not you bruised and cut over your chest and shoulders i cant say he answered but what do you mean did he dare to strike me when i was down he trampled on and kicked you and dashed you on the ground i whispered and his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth because hes only half man not so much and the rest fiend mr earnshaw looked up like me to the countenance of our mutual foe who absorbed in his anguish seemed insensible to anything around him the longer he stood the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features oh if god would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony id go to hell with joy groaned the impatient man writhing to rise and sinking back in despair convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle nay its enough that he has murdered one of you i observed aloud at the grange every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for mr heathcliff after all it is preferable to be hated than loved by him when i recollect how happy we were how happy catherine was before he came im fit to curse the day most likely heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said than the spirit of the person who said it his attention was roused i saw for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs i stared full at him and laughed scornfully the clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me the fiend which usually looked out however was so dimmed and drowned that i did not fear to hazard another sound of derision get up and begone out of my sight said the mourner i guessed he uttered those words at least though his voice was hardly intelligible i beg your pardon i replied but i loved catherine too and her brother requires attendance which for her sake i shall supply now that shes dead i see her in hindley hindley has exactly her eyes if you had not tried to gouge them out and made them black and red and her get up wretched idiot before i stamp you to death he cried making a movement that caused me to make one also but then i continued holding myself ready to flee if poor catherine had trusted you and assumed the ridiculous contemptible degrading title of mrs heathcliff she would soon have presented a similar picture she wouldnt have borne your abominable behaviour quietly her detestation and disgust must have found voice the back of the settle and earnshaws person interposed between me and him so instead of endeavouring to reach me he snatched a dinner knife from the table and flung it at my head it struck beneath my ear and stopped the sentence i was uttering but pulling it out i sprang to the door and delivered another which i hope went a little deeper than his missile the last glimpse i caught of him was a furious rush on his part checked by the embrace of his host and both fell locked together on the hearth in my flight through the kitchen i bid joseph speed to his master i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair back in the doorway and blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory i bounded leaped and flew down the steep road then quitting its windings shot direct across the moor rolling over banks and wading through marshes precipitating myself in fact towards the beacon light of the grange and far rather would i be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than even for one night abide beneath the roof of wuthering heights again isabella ceased speaking and took a drink of tea then she rose and bidding me put on her bonnet and a great shawl i had brought and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour she stepped on to a chair kissed edgars and catherines portraits bestowed a similar salute on me and descended to the carriage accompanied by fanny who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress she was driven away never to revisit this neighbourhood but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled i believe her new abode was in the south near london there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape he was christened linton and from the first she reported him to be an ailing peevish creature mr heathcliff meeting me one day in the village inquired where she lived i refused to tell he remarked that it was not of any moment only she must beware of coming to her brother she should not be with him if he had to keep her himself though i would give no information he discovered through some of the other servants both her place of residence and the existence of the child still he didnt molest her for which forbearance she might thank his aversion i suppose he often asked about the infant when he saw me and on hearing its name smiled grimly and observed they wish me to hate it too do they i dont think they wish you to know anything about it i answered but ill have it he said when i want it they may reckon on that fortunately its mother died before the time arrived some thirteen years after the decease of catherine when linton was twelve or a little more on the day succeeding isabellas unexpected visit i had no opportunity of speaking to my master he shunned conversation and was fit for discussing nothing when i could get him to listen i saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow so deep and sensitive was his aversion that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of heathcliff grief and that together transformed him into a complete hermit he threw up his office of magistrate ceased even to attend church avoided the village on all occasions and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds only varied by solitary rambles on the moors and visits to the grave of his wife mostly at evening or early morning before other wanderers were abroad but he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long he didnt pray for catherines soul to haunt him time brought resignation and a melancholy sweeter than common joy he recalled her memory with ardent tender love and hopeful aspiring to the better world where he doubted not she was gone and he had earthly consolation and affections also for a few days i said he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed that coldness melted as fast as snow in april and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despots sceptre in his heart it was named catherine but he never called it the name in full as he had never called the first catherine short probably because heathcliff had a habit of doing so the little one was always cathy it formed to him a distinction from the mother and yet a connection with her and his attachment sprang from its relation to her far more than from its being his own i used to draw a comparison between him and hindley earnshaw and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances they had both been fond husbands and were both attached to their children and i could not see how they shouldnt both have taken the same road for good or evil but i thought in my mind hindley with apparently the stronger head has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man when his ship struck the captain abandoned his post and the crew instead of trying to save her rushed into riot and confusion leaving no hope for their luckless vessel linton on the contrary displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul he trusted god and god comforted him one hoped and the other despaired they chose their own lots and were righteously doomed to endure them but youll not want to hear my moralising mr lockwood youll judge as well as i can all these things at least youll think you will and thats the same the end of earnshaw was what might have been expected it followed fast on his sisters there were scarcely six months between them we at the grange never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it all that i did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral mr kenneth came to announce the event to my master well nelly said he riding into the yard one morning too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news its yours and my turn to go into mourning at present whos given us the slip now do you think who i asked in a flurry why guess he returned dismounting and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door and nip up the corner of your apron im certain youll need it not mr heathcliff surely i exclaimed what would you have tears for him said the doctor no heathcliffs a tough young fellow he looks blooming to day ive just seen him hes rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half who is it then mr kenneth i repeated impatiently hindley earnshaw your old friend hindley he replied and my wicked gossip though hes been too wild for me this long while there i said we should draw water but cheer up he died true to his character drunk as a lord poor lad im sorry too one cant help missing an old companion though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined and has done me many a rascally turn hes barely twenty seven it seems thats your own age who would have thought you were born in one year i confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of mrs lintons death ancient associations lingered round my heart i sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation desiring mr kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master i could not hinder myself from pondering on the question had he had fair play whatever i did that idea would bother me it was so tiresomely pertinacious that i resolved on requesting leave to go to wuthering heights and assist in the last duties to the dead mr linton was extremely reluctant to consent but i pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay and i said my old master and foster brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own besides i reminded him that the child hareton was his wifes nephew and in the absence of nearer kin he ought to act as its guardian and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left and look over the concerns of his brother in law he was unfit for attending to such matters then but he bid me speak to his lawyer and at length permitted me to go his lawyer had been earnshaws also i called at the village and asked him to accompany me he shook his head and advised that heathcliff should be let alone affirming if the truth were known hareton would be found little else than a beggar his father died in debt he said the whole property is mortgaged and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the creditors heart that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him when i reached the heights i explained that i had come to see everything carried on decently and joseph who appeared in sufficient distress expressed satisfaction at my presence mr heathcliff said he did not perceive that i was wanted but i might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral if i chose correctly he remarked that fools body should be buried at the cross roads without ceremony of any kind i happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday afternoon and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately we broke in this morning for we heard him snorting like a horse and there he was laid over the settle flaying and scalping would not have wakened him i sent for kenneth and he came but not till the beast had changed into carrion he was both dead and cold and stark and so youll allow it was useless making more stir about him the old servant confirmed this statement but muttered id rayther hed goan hisseln for t doctor i sud ha taen tent o t maister better nor him and he warnt deead when i left naught o t soart i insisted on the funeral being respectable mr heathcliff said i might have my own way there too only he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket he maintained a hard careless deportment indicative of neither joy nor sorrow if anything it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed i observed once indeed something like exultation in his aspect it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house he had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner and previous to following with hareton he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered with peculiar gusto now my bonny lad you are mine and well see if one tree wont grow as crooked as another with the same wind to twist it the unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech he played with heathcliffs whiskers and stroked his cheek but i divined its meaning and observed tartly that boy must go back with me to thrushcross grange sir there is nothing in the world less yours than he is does linton say so he demanded of course he has ordered me to take him i replied well said the scoundrel well not argue the subject now but i have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one so intimate to your master that i must supply the place of this with my own if he attempt to remove it i dont engage to let hareton go undisputed but ill be pretty sure to make the other come remember to tell him this hint was enough to bind our hands i repeated its substance on my return and edgar linton little interested at the commencement spoke no more of interfering im not aware that he could have done it to any purpose had he been ever so willing the guest was now the master of wuthering heights he held firm possession and proved to the attorney who in his turn proved it to mr linton that earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming and he heathcliff was the mortgagee in that manner hareton who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his fathers inveterate enemy and lives in his own house as a servant deprived of the advantage of wages quite unable to right himself because of his friendlessness and his ignorance that he has been wronged
