the twelve years continued mrs dean following that dismal period were the happiest of my life my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little ladys trifling illnesses which she had to experience in common with all children rich and poor for the rest after the first six months she grew like a larch and could walk and talk too in her own way before the heath blossomed a second time over mrs lintons dust she was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house a real beauty in face with the earnshaws handsome dark eyes but the lintons fair skin and small features and yellow curling hair her spirit was high though not rough and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its affections that capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother still she did not resemble her for she could be soft and mild as a dove and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression her anger was never furious her love never fierce it was deep and tender however it must be acknowledged she had faults to foil her gifts a propensity to be saucy was one and a perverse will that indulged children invariably acquire whether they be good tempered or cross if a servant chanced to vex her it was always i shall tell papa and if he reproved her even by a look you would have thought it a heart breaking business i dont believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her he took her education entirely on himself and made it an amusement fortunately curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar she learned rapidly and eagerly and did honour to his teaching till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the range of the park by herself mr linton would take her with him a mile or so outside on rare occasions but he trusted her to no one else gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears the chapel the only building she had approached or entered except her own home wuthering heights and mr heathcliff did not exist for her she was a perfect recluse and apparently perfectly contented sometimes indeed while surveying the country from her nursery window she would observe ellen how long will it be before i can walk to the top of those hills i wonder what lies on the other side is it the sea no miss cathy i would answer it is hills again just like these and what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them she once asked the abrupt descent of penistone crags particularly attracted her notice especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow i explained that they were bare masses of stone with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree and why are they bright so long after it is evening here she pursued because they are a great deal higher up than we are replied i you could not climb them they are too high and steep in winter the frost is always there before it comes to us and deep into summer i have found snow under that black hollow on the north east side oh you have been on them she cried gleefully then i can go too when i am a woman has papa been ellen papa would tell you miss i answered hastily that they are not worth the trouble of visiting the moors where you ramble with him are much nicer and thrushcross park is the finest place in the world but i know the park and i dont know those she murmured to herself and i should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point my little pony minny shall take me some time one of the maids mentioning the fairy cave quite turned her head with a desire to fulfil this project she teased mr linton about it and he promised she should have the journey when she got older but miss catherine measured her age by months and now am i old enough to go to penistone crags was the constant question in her mouth the road thither wound close by wuthering heights edgar had not the heart to pass it so she received as constantly the answer not yet love not yet i said mrs heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her husband her family were of a delicate constitution she and edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts what her last illness was i am not certain i conjecture they died of the same thing a kind of fever slow at its commencement but incurable and rapidly consuming life towards the close she wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four months indisposition under which she had suffered and entreated him to come to her if possible for she had much to settle and she wished to bid him adieu and deliver linton safely into his hands her hope was that linton might be left with him as he had been with her his father she would fain convince herself had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or education my master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls he flew to answer this commending catherine to my peculiar vigilance in his absence with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied he was away three weeks the first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the library too sad for either reading or playing in that quiet state she caused me little trouble but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient fretful weariness and being too busy and too old then to run up and down amusing her i hit on a method by which she might entertain herself i used to send her on her travels round the grounds now on foot and now on a pony indulging her with a patient audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned the summer shone in full prime and she took such a taste for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales i did not fear her breaking bounds because the gates were generally locked and i thought she would scarcely venture forth alone if they had stood wide open unluckily my confidence proved misplaced catherine came to me one morning at eight oclock and said she was that day an arabian merchant going to cross the desert with his caravan and i must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts a horse and three camels personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers i got together good store of dainties and slung them in a basket on one side of the saddle and she sprang up as gay as a fairy sheltered by her wide brimmed hat and gauze veil from the july sun and trotted off with a merry laugh mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping and come back early the naughty thing never made her appearance at tea one traveller the hound being an old dog and fond of its ease returned but neither cathy nor the pony nor the two pointers were visible in any direction i despatched emissaries down this path and that path and at last went wandering in search of her myself there was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation on the borders of the grounds i inquired of him if he had seen our young lady i saw her at morn he replied she would have me to cut her a hazel switch and then she leapt her galloway over the hedge yonder where it is lowest and galloped out of sight you may guess how i felt at hearing this news it struck me directly she must have started for penistone crags what will become of her i ejaculated pushing through a gap which the man was repairing and making straight to the high road i walked as if for a wager mile after mile till a turn brought me in view of the heights but no catherine could i detect far or near the crags lie about a mile and a half beyond mr heathcliffs place and that is four from the grange so i began to fear night would fall ere i could reach them and what if she should have slipped in clambering among them i reflected and been killed or broken some of her bones my suspense was truly painful and at first it gave me delightful relief to observe in hurrying by the farmhouse charlie the fiercest of the pointers lying under a window with swelled head and bleeding ear i opened the wicket and ran to the door knocking vehemently for admittance a woman whom i knew and who formerly lived at gimmerton answered she had been servant there since the death of mr earnshaw ah said she you are come a seeking your little mistress dont be frightened shes here safe but im glad it isnt the master he is not at home then is he i panted quite breathless with quick walking and alarm no no she replied both he and joseph are off and i think they wont return this hour or more step in and rest you a bit i entered and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth rocking herself in a little chair that had been her mothers when a child her hat was hung against the wall and she seemed perfectly at home laughing and chattering in the best spirits imaginable to hareton now a great strong lad of eighteen who stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth very well miss i exclaimed concealing my joy under an angry countenance this is your last ride till papa comes back ill not trust you over the threshold again you naughty naughty girl aha ellen she cried gaily jumping up and running to my side i shall have a pretty story to tell to night and so youve found me out have you ever been here in your life before put that hat on and home at once said i im dreadfully grieved at you miss cathy youve done extremely wrong its no use pouting and crying that wont repay the trouble ive had scouring the country after you to think how mr linton charged me to keep you in and you stealing off so it shows you are a cunning little fox and nobody will put faith in you any more what have i done sobbed she instantly checked papa charged me nothing hell not scold me ellen hes never cross like you come come i repeated ill tie the riband now let us have no petulance oh for shame you thirteen years old and such a baby this exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head and retreating to the chimney out of my reach nay said the servant dont be hard on the bonny lass mrs dean we made her stop shed fain have ridden forwards afeard you should be uneasy hareton offered to go with her and i thought he should its a wild road over the hills hareton during the discussion stood with his hands in his pockets too awkward to speak though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion how long am i to wait i continued disregarding the womans interference it will be dark in ten minutes where is the pony miss cathy and where is phoenix i shall leave you unless you be quick so please yourself the pony is in the yard she replied and phoenix is shut in there hes bitten and so is charlie i was going to tell you all about it but you are in a bad temper and dont deserve to hear i picked up her hat and approached to reinstate it but perceiving that the people of the house took her part she commenced capering round the room and on my giving chase ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue hareton and the woman laughed and she joined them and waxed more impertinent still till i cried in great irritation well miss cathy if you were aware whose house this is youd be glad enough to get out its your fathers isnt it said she turning to hareton nay he replied looking down and blushing bashfully he could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes though they were just his own whose then your masters she asked he coloured deeper with a different feeling muttered an oath and turned away who is his master continued the tiresome girl appealing to me he talked about our house and our folk i thought he had been the owners son and he never said miss he should have done shouldnt he if hes a servant hareton grew black as a thunder cloud at this childish speech i silently shook my questioner and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure now get my horse she said addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of the stable boys at the grange and you may come with me i want to see where the goblin hunter rises in the marsh and to hear about the fairishes as you call them but make haste whats the matter get my horse i say ill see thee damned before i be thy servant growled the lad youll see me what asked catherine in surprise damned thou saucy witch he replied there miss cathy you see you have got into pretty company i interposed nice words to be used to a young lady pray dont begin to dispute with him come let us seek for minny ourselves and begone but ellen cried she staring fixed in astonishment how dare he speak so to me mustnt he be made to do as i ask him you wicked creature i shall tell papa what you said now then hareton did not appear to feel this threat so the tears sprang into her eyes with indignation you bring the pony she exclaimed turning to the woman and let my dog free this moment softly miss answered the addressed youll lose nothing by being civil though mr hareton there be not the masters son hes your cousin and i was never hired to serve you he my cousin cried cathy with a scornful laugh yes indeed responded her reprover oh ellen dont let them say such things she pursued in great trouble papa is gone to fetch my cousin from london my cousin is a gentlemans son that my she stopped and wept outright upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown hush hush i whispered people can have many cousins and of all sorts miss cathy without being any the worse for it only they neednt keep their company if they be disagreeable and bad hes not hes not my cousin ellen she went on gathering fresh grief from reflection and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea i was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations having no doubt of lintons approaching arrival communicated by the former being reported to mr heathcliff and feeling as confident that catherines first thought on her fathers return would be to seek an explanation of the latters assertion concerning her rude bred kindred hareton recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant seemed moved by her distress and having fetched the pony round to the door he took to propitiate her a fine crooked legged terrier whelp from the kennel and putting it into her hand bid her whist for he meant nought pausing in her lamentations she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror then burst forth anew i could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow who was a well made athletic youth good looking in features and stout and healthy but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game still i thought i could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds to be sure whose rankness far over topped their neglected growth yet notwithstanding evidence of a wealthy soil that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances mr heathcliff i believe had not treated him physically ill thanks to his fearless nature which offered no temptation to that course of oppression he had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to ill treatment in heathcliffs judgment he appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute he was never taught to read or write never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper never led a single step towards virtue or guarded by a single precept against vice and from what i heard joseph contributed much to his deterioration by a narrow minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him as a boy because he was the head of the old family and as he had been in the habit of accusing catherine earnshaw and heathcliff when children of putting the master past his patience and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their offald ways so at present he laid the whole burden of haretons faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property if the lad swore he wouldnt correct him nor however culpably he behaved it gave joseph satisfaction apparently to watch him go the worst lengths he allowed that the lad was ruined that his soul was abandoned to perdition but then he reflected that heathcliff must answer for it haretons blood would be required at his hands and there lay immense consolation in that thought joseph had instilled into him a pride of name and of his lineage he would had he dared have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the heights but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations i dont pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at wuthering heights i only speak from hearsay for i saw little the villagers affirmed mr heathcliff was near and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants but the house inside had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management and the scenes of riot common in hindleys time were not now enacted within its walls the master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people good or bad and he is yet this however is not making progress with my story miss cathy rejected the peace offering of the terrier and demanded her own dogs charlie and phoenix they came limping and hanging their heads and we set out for home sadly out of sorts every one of us i could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day except that as i supposed the goal of her pilgrimage was penistone crags and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse when hareton happened to issue forth attended by some canine followers who attacked her train they had a smart battle before their owners could separate them that formed an introduction catherine told hareton who she was and where she was going and asked him to show her the way finally beguiling him to accompany her he opened the mysteries of the fairy cave and twenty other queer places but being in disgrace i was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw i could gather however that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant and heathcliffs housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart she who was always love and darling and queen and angel with everybody at the grange to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger she did not comprehend it and hard work i had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father i explained how he objected to the whole household at the heights and how sorry he would be to find she had been there but i insisted most on the fact that if she revealed my negligence of his orders he would perhaps be so angry that i should have to leave and cathy couldnt bear that prospect she pledged her word and kept it for my sake after all she was a sweet little girl
