another week over and i am so many days nearer health and spring i have now heard all my neighbours history at different sittings as the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations ill continue it in her own words only a little condensed she is on the whole a very fair narrator and i dont think i could improve her style * * * * * in the evening she said the evening of my visit to the heights i knew as well as if i saw him that mr heathcliff was about the place and i shunned going out because i still carried his letter in my pocket and didnt want to be threatened or teased any more i had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere as i could not guess how its receipt would affect catherine the consequence was that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days the fourth was sunday and i brought it into her room after the family were gone to church there was a man servant left to keep the house with me and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that i set them wide open and to fulfil my engagement as i knew who would be coming i told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges and he must run over to the village and get a few to be paid for on the morrow he departed and i went upstairs mrs linton sat in a loose white dress with a light shawl over her shoulders in the recess of the open window as usual her thick long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness and now she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck her appearance was altered as i had told heathcliff but when she was calm there seemed unearthly beauty in the change the flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her they appeared always to gaze beyond and far beyond you would have said out of this world then the paleness of her face its haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered flesh and the peculiar expression arising from her mental state though painfully suggestive of their causes added to the touching interest which she awakened and invariably to me i know and to any person who saw her i should think refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence and stamped her as one doomed to decay a book lay spread on the sill before her and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals i believe linton had laid it there for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading or occupation of any kind and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement she was conscious of his aim and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses at other times she would turn petulantly away and hide her face in her hands or even push him off angrily and then he took care to let her alone for he was certain of doing no good gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing and the full mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear it was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage which drowned that music about the grange when the trees were in leaf at wuthering heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of steady rain and of wuthering heights catherine was thinking as she listened that is if she thought or listened at all but she had the vague distant look i mentioned before which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye theres a letter for you mrs linton i said gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee you must read it immediately because it wants an answer shall i break the seal yes she answered without altering the direction of her eyes i opened it it was very short now i continued read it she drew away her hand and let it fall i replaced it in her lap and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down but that movement was so long delayed that at last i resumed must i read it maam it is from mr heathcliff there was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection and a struggle to arrange her ideas she lifted the letter and seemed to peruse it and when she came to the signature she sighed yet still i found she had not gathered its import for upon my desiring to hear her reply she merely pointed to the name and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness well he wishes to see you said i guessing her need of an interpreter hes in the garden by this time and impatient to know what answer i shall bring as i spoke i observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark and then smoothing them back announce by a wag of the tail that some one approached whom it did not consider a stranger mrs linton bent forward and listened breathlessly the minute after a step traversed the hall the open house was too tempting for heathcliff to resist walking in most likely he supposed that i was inclined to shirk my promise and so resolved to trust to his own audacity with straining eagerness catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber he did not hit the right room directly she motioned me to admit him but he found it out ere i could reach the door and in a stride or two was at her side and had her grasped in his arms he neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before i daresay but then my mistress had kissed him first and i plainly saw that he could hardly bear for downright agony to look into her face the same conviction had stricken him as me from the instant he beheld her that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there she was fated sure to die oh cathy oh my life how can i bear it was the first sentence he uttered in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair and now he stared at her so earnestly that i thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eyes but they burned with anguish they did not melt what now said catherine leaning back and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices you and edgar have broken my heart heathcliff and you both come to bewail the deed to me as if you were the people to be pitied i shall not pity you not i you have killed me and thriven on it i think how strong you are how many years do you mean to live after i am gone heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her he attempted to rise but she seized his hair and kept him down i wish i could hold you she continued bitterly till we were both dead i shouldnt care what you suffered i care nothing for your sufferings why shouldnt you suffer i do will you forget me will you be happy when i am in the earth will you say twenty years hence thats the grave of catherine earnshaw i loved her long ago and was wretched to lose her but it is past ive loved many others since my children are dearer to me than she was and at death i shall not rejoice that i am going to her i shall be sorry that i must leave them will you say so heathcliff dont torture me till im as mad as yourself cried he wrenching his head free and grinding his teeth the two to a cool spectator made a strange and fearful picture well might catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping as to her companion while raising himself with one hand he had taken her arm with the other and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition that on his letting go i saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin are you possessed with a devil he pursued savagely to talk in that manner to me when you are dying do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory and eating deeper eternally after you have left me you know you lie to say i have killed you and catherine you know that i could as soon forget you as my existence is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness that while you are at peace i shall writhe in the torments of hell i shall not be at peace moaned catherine recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent unequal throbbing of her heart which beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation she said nothing further till the paroxysm was over then she continued more kindly im not wishing you greater torment than i have heathcliff i only wish us never to be parted and should a word of mine distress you hereafter think i feel the same distress underground and for my own sake forgive me come here and kneel down again you never harmed me in your life nay if you nurse anger that will be worse to remember than my harsh words wont you come here again do heathcliff went to the back of her chair and leant over but not so far as to let her see his face which was livid with emotion she bent round to look at him he would not permit it turning abruptly he walked to the fireplace where he stood silent with his back towards us mrs lintons glance followed him suspiciously every movement woke a new sentiment in her after a pause and a prolonged gaze she resumed addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment oh you see nelly he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave that is how im loved well never mind that is not my heathcliff i shall love mine yet and take him with me hes in my soul and added she musingly the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison after all im tired of being enclosed here im wearying to escape into that glorious world and to be always there not seeing it dimly through tears and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart but really with it and in it nelly you think you are better and more fortunate than i in full health and strength you are sorry for me very soon that will be altered i shall be sorry for you i shall be incomparably beyond and above you all i wonder he wont be near me she went on to herself i thought he wished it heathcliff dear you should not be sullen now do come to me heathcliff in her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair at that earnest appeal he turned to her looking absolutely desperate his eyes wide and wet at last flashed fiercely on her his breast heaved convulsively an instant they held asunder and then how they met i hardly saw but catherine made a spring and he caught her and they were locked in an embrace from which i thought my mistress would never be released alive in fact to my eyes she seemed directly insensible he flung himself into the nearest seat and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted he gnashed at me and foamed like a mad dog and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy i did not feel as if i were in the company of a creature of my own species it appeared that he would not understand though i spoke to him so i stood off and held my tongue in great perplexity a movement of catherines relieved me a little presently she put up her hand to clasp his neck and bring her cheek to his as he held her while he in return covering her with frantic caresses said wildly you teach me now how cruel youve been cruel and false why did you despise me why did you betray your own heart cathy i have not one word of comfort you deserve this you have killed yourself yes you may kiss me and cry and wring out my kisses and tears theyll blight you theyll damn you you loved me then what right had you to leave me what right answer me for the poor fancy you felt for linton because misery and degradation and death and nothing that god or satan could inflict would have parted us you of your own will did it i have not broken your heart you have broken it and in breaking it you have broken mine so much the worse for me that i am strong do i want to live what kind of living will it be when you oh god would you like to live with your soul in the grave let me alone let me alone sobbed catherine if ive done wrong im dying for it it is enough you left me too but i wont upbraid you i forgive you forgive me it is hard to forgive and to look at those eyes and feel those wasted hands he answered kiss me again and dont let me see your eyes i forgive what you have done to me i love my murderer but yours how can i they were silent their faces hid against each other and washed by each others tears at least i suppose the weeping was on both sides as it seemed heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this i grew very uncomfortable meanwhile for the afternoon wore fast away the man whom i had sent off returned from his errand and i could distinguish by the shine of the western sun up the valley a concourse thickening outside gimmerton chapel porch service is over i announced my master will be here in half an hour heathcliff groaned a curse and strained catherine closer she never moved ere long i perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing mr linton was not far behind he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer now he is here i exclaimed for heavens sake hurry down youll not meet any one on the front stairs do be quick and stay among the trees till he is fairly in i must go cathy said heathcliff seeking to extricate himself from his companions arms but if i live ill see you again before you are asleep i wont stray five yards from your window you must not go she answered holding him as firmly as her strength allowed you shall not i tell you for one hour he pleaded earnestly not for one minute she replied i must linton will be up immediately persisted the alarmed intruder he would have risen and unfixed her fingers by the act she clung fast gasping there was mad resolution in her face no she shrieked oh dont dont go it is the last time edgar will not hurt us heathcliff i shall die i shall die damn the fool there he is cried heathcliff sinking back into his seat hush my darling hush hush catherine ill stay if he shot me so id expire with a blessing on my lips and there they were fast again i heard my master mounting the stairs the cold sweat ran from my forehead i was horrified are you going to listen to her ravings i said passionately she does not know what she says will you ruin her because she has not wit to help herself get up you could be free instantly that is the most diabolical deed that ever you did we are all done for master mistress and servant i wrung my hands and cried out and mr linton hastened his step at the noise in the midst of my agitation i was sincerely glad to observe that catherines arms had fallen relaxed and her head hung down shes fainted or dead i thought so much the better far better that she should be dead than lingering a burden and a misery maker to all about her edgar sprang to his unbidden guest blanched with astonishment and rage what he meant to do i cannot tell however the other stopped all demonstrations at once by placing the lifeless looking form in his arms look there he said unless you be a fiend help her first then you shall speak to me he walked into the parlour and sat down mr linton summoned me and with great difficulty and after resorting to many means we managed to restore her to sensation but she was all bewildered she sighed and moaned and knew nobody edgar in his anxiety for her forgot her hated friend i did not i went at the earliest opportunity and besought him to depart affirming that catherine was better and he should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night i shall not refuse to go out of doors he answered but i shall stay in the garden and nelly mind you keep your word to morrow i shall be under those larch trees mind or i pay another visit whether linton be in or not he sent a rapid glance through the half open door of the chamber and ascertaining that what i stated was apparently true delivered the house of his luckless presence
