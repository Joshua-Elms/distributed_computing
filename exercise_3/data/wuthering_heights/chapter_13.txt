for two months the fugitives remained absent in those two months mrs linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever no mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than edgar tended her day and night he was watching and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict and though kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future anxiety in fact that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity he knew no limits in gratitude and joy when catherines life was declared out of danger and hour after hour he would sit beside her tracing the gradual return to bodily health and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also and she would soon be entirely her former self the first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following march mr linton had put on her pillow in the morning a handful of golden crocuses her eye long stranger to any gleam of pleasure caught them in waking and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together these are the earliest flowers at the heights she exclaimed they remind me of soft thaw winds and warm sunshine and nearly melted snow edgar is there not a south wind and is not the snow almost gone the snow is quite gone down here darling replied her husband and i only see two white spots on the whole range of moors the sky is blue and the larks are singing and the becks and brooks are all brim full catherine last spring at this time i was longing to have you under this roof now i wish you were a mile or two up those hills the air blows so sweetly i feel that it would cure you i shall never be there but once more said the invalid and then youll leave me and i shall remain for ever next spring youll long again to have me under this roof and youll look back and think you were happy to day linton lavished on her the kindest caresses and tried to cheer her by the fondest words but vaguely regarding the flowers she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding we knew she was really better and therefore decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency and it might be partially removed by a change of scene the master told me to light a fire in the many weeks deserted parlour and to set an easy chair in the sunshine by the window and then he brought her down and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat and as we expected revived by the objects round her which though familiar were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber by evening she seemed greatly exhausted yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment and i had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed till another room could be prepared to obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs we fitted up this where you lie at present on the same floor with the parlour and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other leaning on edgars arm ah i thought myself she might recover so waited on as she was and there was double cause to desire it for on her existence depended that of another we cherished the hope that in a little while mr lintons heart would be gladdened and his lands secured from a strangers gripe by the birth of an heir i should mention that isabella sent to her brother some six weeks from her departure a short note announcing her marriage with heathcliff it appeared dry and cold but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation if her proceeding had offended him asserting that she could not help it then and being done she had now no power to repeal it linton did not reply to this i believe and in a fortnight more i got a long letter which i considered odd coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon ill read it for i keep it yet any relic of the dead is precious if they were valued living * * * * * dear ellen it begins i came last night to wuthering heights and heard for the first time that catherine has been and is yet very ill i must not write to her i suppose and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what i sent him still i must write to somebody and the only choice left me is you inform edgar that id give the world to see his face again that my heart returned to thrushcross grange in twenty four hours after i left it and is there at this moment full of warm feelings for him and catherine i cant follow it though these words are underlined they need not expect me and they may draw what conclusions they please taking care however to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection the remainder of the letter is for yourself alone i want to ask you two questions the first is how did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here i cannot recognise any sentiment which those around share with me the second question i have great interest in it is this is mr heathcliff a man if so is he mad and if not is he a devil i shant tell my reasons for making this inquiry but i beseech you to explain if you can what i have married that is when you call to see me and you must call ellen very soon dont write but come and bring me something from edgar now you shall hear how i have been received in my new home as i am led to imagine the heights will be it is to amuse myself that i dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts they never occupy my thoughts except at the moment when i miss them i should laugh and dance for joy if i found their absence was the total of my miseries and the rest was an unnatural dream the sun set behind the grange as we turned on to the moors by that i judged it to be six oclock and my companion halted half an hour to inspect the park and the gardens and probably the place itself as well as he could so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse and your old fellow servant joseph issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle he did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit his first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face squint malignantly project his under lip and turn away then he took the two horses and led them into the stables reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate as if we lived in an ancient castle heathcliff stayed to speak to him and i entered the kitchen a dingy untidy hole i daresay you would not know it it is so changed since it was in your charge by the fire stood a ruffianly child strong in limb and dirty in garb with a look of catherine in his eyes and about his mouth this is edgars legal nephew i reflected mine in a manner i must shake hands and yes i must kiss him it is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning i approached and attempting to take his chubby fist said how do you do my dear he replied in a jargon i did not comprehend shall you and i be friends hareton was my next essay at conversation an oath and a threat to set throttler on me if i did not frame off rewarded my perseverance hey throttler lad whispered the little wretch rousing a half bred bull dog from its lair in a corner now wilt thou be ganging he asked authoritatively love for my life urged a compliance i stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter mr heathcliff was nowhere visible and joseph whom i followed to the stables and requested to accompany me in after staring and muttering to himself screwed up his nose and replied mim mim mim did iver christian body hear aught like it mincing un munching how can i tell whet ye say i say i wish you to come with me into the house i cried thinking him deaf yet highly disgusted at his rudeness none o me i getten summut else to do he answered and continued his work moving his lantern jaws meanwhile and surveying my dress and countenance the former a great deal too fine but the latter im sure as sad as he could desire with sovereign contempt i walked round the yard and through a wicket to another door at which i took the liberty of knocking in hopes some more civil servant might show himself after a short suspense it was opened by a tall gaunt man without neckerchief and otherwise extremely slovenly his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders and his eyes too were like a ghostly catherines with all their beauty annihilated whats your business here he demanded grimly who are you my name was isabella linton i replied youve seen me before sir im lately married to mr heathcliff and he has brought me here i suppose by your permission is he come back then asked the hermit glaring like a hungry wolf yes we came just now i said but he left me by the kitchen door and when i would have gone in your little boy played sentinel over the place and frightened me off by the help of a bull dog its well the hellish villain has kept his word growled my future host searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering heathcliff and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations and threats of what he would have done had the fiend deceived him i repented having tried this second entrance and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing but ere i could execute that intention he ordered me in and shut and re fastened the door there was a great fire and that was all the light in the huge apartment whose floor had grown a uniform grey and the once brilliant pewter dishes which used to attract my gaze when i was a girl partook of a similar obscurity created by tarnish and dust i inquired whether i might call the maid and be conducted to a bedroom mr earnshaw vouchsafed no answer he walked up and down with his hands in his pockets apparently quite forgetting my presence and his abstraction was evidently so deep and his whole aspect so misanthropical that i shrank from disturbing him again youll not be surprised ellen at my feeling particularly cheerless seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home containing the only people i loved on earth and there might as well be the atlantic to part us instead of those four miles i could not overpass them i questioned with myself where must i turn for comfort and mind you dont tell edgar or catherine above every sorrow beside this rose pre eminent despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against heathcliff i had sought shelter at wuthering heights almost gladly because i was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him but he knew the people we were coming amongst and he did not fear their intermeddling i sat and thought a doleful time the clock struck eight and nine and still my companion paced to and fro his head bent on his breast and perfectly silent unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals i listened to detect a womans voice in the house and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations which at last spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping i was not aware how openly i grieved till earnshaw halted opposite in his measured walk and gave me a stare of newly awakened surprise taking advantage of his recovered attention i exclaimed im tired with my journey and i want to go to bed where is the maid servant direct me to her as she wont come to me we have none he answered you must wait on yourself where must i sleep then i sobbed i was beyond regarding self respect weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness joseph will show you heathcliffs chamber said he open that door hes in there i was going to obey but he suddenly arrested me and added in the strangest tone be so good as to turn your lock and draw your bolt dont omit it well i said but why mr earnshaw i did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with heathcliff look here he replied pulling from his waistcoat a curiously constructed pistol having a double edged spring knife attached to the barrel thats a great tempter to a desperate man is it not i cannot resist going up with this every night and trying his door if once i find it open hes done for i do it invariably even though the minute before i have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me refrain it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him you fight against that devil for love as long as you may when the time comes not all the angels in heaven shall save him i surveyed the weapon inquisitively a hideous notion struck me how powerful i should be possessing such an instrument i took it from his hand and touched the blade he looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second it was not horror it was covetousness he snatched the pistol back jealously shut the knife and returned it to its concealment i dont care if you tell him said he put him on his guard and watch for him you know the terms we are on i see his danger does not shock you what has heathcliff done to you i asked in what has he wronged you to warrant this appalling hatred wouldnt it be wiser to bid him quit the house no thundered earnshaw should he offer to leave me hes a dead man persuade him to attempt it and you are a murderess am i to lose all without a chance of retrieval is hareton to be a beggar oh damnation i will have it back and ill have his gold too and then his blood and hell shall have his soul it will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before youve acquainted me ellen with your old masters habits he is clearly on the verge of madness he was so last night at least i shuddered to be near him and thought on the servants ill bred moroseness as comparatively agreeable he now recommenced his moody walk and i raised the latch and escaped into the kitchen joseph was bending over the fire peering into a large pan that swung above it and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by the contents of the pan began to boil and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl i conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper and being hungry i resolved it should be eatable so crying out sharply ill make the porridge i removed the vessel out of his reach and proceeded to take off my hat and riding habit mr earnshaw i continued directs me to wait on myself i will im not going to act the lady among you for fear i should starve gooid lord he muttered sitting down and stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle if theres to be fresh ortherings just when i getten used to two maisters if i mun hev a mistress set oer my heead its like time to be flitting i niver did think to see t day that i mud lave th owld place but i doubt its nigh at hand this lamentation drew no notice from me i went briskly to work sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun but compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance it racked me to recall past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition the quicker the thible ran round and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the water joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation thear he ejaculated hareton thou willnt sup thy porridge to neeght theyll be naught but lumps as big as my neive thear agean id fling in bowl un all if i wer ye there pale t guilp off un then yell hae done wit bang bang its a mercy t bothom isnt deaved out it was rather a rough mess i own when poured into the basins four had been provided and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy which hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip i expostulated and desired that he should have his in a mug affirming that i could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily the old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety assuring me repeatedly that the barn was every bit as good as i and every bit as wollsome and wondering how i could fashion to be so conceited meanwhile the infant ruffian continued sucking and glowered up at me defyingly as he slavered into the jug i shall have my supper in another room i said have you no place you call a parlour parlour he echoed sneeringly parlour nay weve noa parlours if yah dunnut loike wer company theres maisters un if yah dunnut loike maister theres us then i shall go upstairs i answered show me a chamber i put my basin on a tray and went myself to fetch some more milk with great grumblings the fellow rose and preceded me in my ascent we mounted to the garrets he opened a door now and then to look into the apartments we passed heres a rahm he said at last flinging back a cranky board on hinges its weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in theres a pack o corn i t corner thear meeterly clane if yere feared o muckying yer grand silk cloes spread yer hankerchir o t top ont the rahm was a kind of lumber hole smelling strong of malt and grain various sacks of which articles were piled around leaving a wide bare space in the middle why man i exclaimed facing him angrily this is not a place to sleep in i wish to see my bed room bed rume he repeated in a tone of mockery yahs see all t bed rumes thear is yons mine he pointed into the second garret only differing from the first in being more naked about the walls and having a large low curtainless bed with an indigo coloured quilt at one end what do i want with yours i retorted i suppose mr heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the house does he oh its maister hathecliffs yere wanting cried he as if making a new discovery couldnt ye ha said soa at onst un then i mud ha telled ye baht all this wark that thats just one ye cannut see he allas keeps it locked un nobdy iver mells ont but hisseln youve a nice house joseph i could not refrain from observing and pleasant inmates and i think the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day i linked my fate with theirs however that is not to the present purpose there are other rooms for heavens sake be quick and let me settle somewhere he made no reply to this adjuration only plodding doggedly down the wooden steps and halting before an apartment which from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture i conjectured to be the best one there was a carpet a good one but the pattern was obliterated by dust a fireplace hung with cut paper dropping to pieces a handsome oak bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make but they had evidently experienced rough usage the vallances hung in festoons wrenched from their rings and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side causing the drapery to trail upon the floor the chairs were also damaged many of them severely and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls i was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession when my fool of a guide announced this here is t maisters my supper by this time was cold my appetite gone and my patience exhausted i insisted on being provided instantly with a place of refuge and means of repose whear the divil began the religious elder the lord bless us the lord forgie us whear the hell wold ye gang ye marred wearisome nowt yeve seen all but haretons bit of a chamer theres not another hoile to lig down in i th hahse i was so vexed i flung my tray and its contents on the ground and then seated myself at the stairs head hid my face in my hands and cried ech ech exclaimed joseph weel done miss cathy weel done miss cathy howsiver t maister sall just tumle oer them brocken pots un then wes hear summut wes hear how its to be gooid for naught madling ye desarve pining fro this to churstmas flinging t precious gifts uh god under fooit i yer flaysome rages but im mistaen if ye shew yer sperrit lang will hathecliff bide sich bonny ways think ye i nobbut wish he may catch ye i that plisky i nobbut wish he may and so he went on scolding to his den beneath taking the candle with him and i remained in the dark the period of reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath and bestirring myself to remove its effects an unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of throttler whom i now recognised as a son of our old skulker it had spent its whelphood at the grange and was given by my father to mr hindley i fancy it knew me it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute and then hastened to devour the porridge while i groped from step to step collecting the shattered earthenware and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket handkerchief our labours were scarcely over when i heard earnshaws tread in the passage my assistant tucked in his tail and pressed to the wall i stole into the nearest doorway the dogs endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful as i guessed by a scutter downstairs and a prolonged piteous yelping i had better luck he passed on entered his chamber and shut the door directly after joseph came up with hareton to put him to bed i had found shelter in haretons room and the old man on seeing me said theys rahm for boath ye un yer pride now i sud think i the hahse its empty ye may hev it all to yerseln un him as allas maks a third i sich ill company gladly did i take advantage of this intimation and the minute i flung myself into a chair by the fire i nodded and slept my slumber was deep and sweet though over far too soon mr heathcliff awoke me he had just come in and demanded in his loving manner what i was doing there i told him the cause of my staying up so late that he had the key of our room in his pocket the adjective our gave mortal offence he swore it was not nor ever should be mine and hed but ill not repeat his language nor describe his habitual conduct he is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence i sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear yet i assure you a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he wakens he told me of catherines illness and accused my brother of causing it promising that i should be edgars proxy in suffering till he could get hold of him i do hate him i am wretched i have been a fool beware of uttering one breath of this to any one at the grange i shall expect you every day dont disappoint me isabella
