at the close of three weeks i was able to quit my chamber and move about the house and on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening i asked catherine to read to me because my eyes were weak we were in the library the master having gone to bed she consented rather unwillingly i fancied and imagining my sort of books did not suit her i bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused she selected one of her own favourites and got forward steadily about an hour then came frequent questions ellen are not you tired hadnt you better lie down now youll be sick keeping up so long ellen no no dear im not tired i returned continually perceiving me immovable she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation it changed to yawning and stretching and ellen im tired give over then and talk i answered that was worse she fretted and sighed and looked at her watch till eight and finally went to her room completely overdone with sleep judging by her peevish heavy look and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes the following night she seemed more impatient still and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache and left me i thought her conduct odd and having remained alone a long while i resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better and asking her to come and lie on the sofa instead of upstairs in the dark no catherine could i discover upstairs and none below the servants affirmed they had not seen her i listened at mr edgars door all was silence i returned to her apartment extinguished my candle and seated myself in the window the moon shone bright a sprinkling of snow covered the ground and i reflected that she might possibly have taken it into her head to walk about the garden for refreshment i did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park but it was not my young mistress on its emerging into the light i recognised one of the grooms he stood a considerable period viewing the carriage road through the grounds then started off at a brisk pace as if he had detected something and reappeared presently leading misss pony and there she was just dismounted and walking by its side the man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable cathy entered by the casement window of the drawing room and glided noiselessly up to where i awaited her she put the door gently to slipped off her snowy shoes untied her hat and was proceeding unconscious of my espionage to lay aside her mantle when i suddenly rose and revealed myself the surprise petrified her an instant she uttered an inarticulate exclamation and stood fixed my dear miss catherine i began too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold where have you been riding out at this hour and why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale where have you been speak to the bottom of the park she stammered i didnt tell a tale and nowhere else i demanded no was the muttered reply oh catherine i cried sorrowfully you know you have been doing wrong or you wouldnt be driven to uttering an untruth to me that does grieve me id rather be three months ill than hear you frame a deliberate lie she sprang forward and bursting into tears threw her arms round my neck well ellen im so afraid of you being angry she said promise not to be angry and you shall know the very truth i hate to hide it we sat down in the window seat i assured her i would not scold whatever her secret might be and i guessed it of course so she commenced ive been to wuthering heights ellen and ive never missed going a day since you fell ill except thrice before and twice after you left your room i gave michael books and pictures to prepare minny every evening and to put her back in the stable you mustnt scold him either mind i was at the heights by half past six and generally stayed till half past eight and then galloped home it was not to amuse myself that i went i was often wretched all the time now and then i was happy once in a week perhaps at first i expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to linton for i had engaged to call again next day when we quitted him but as you stayed upstairs on the morrow i escaped that trouble while michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon i got possession of the key and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him because he was sick and couldnt come to the grange and how papa would object to my going and then i negotiated with him about the pony he is fond of reading and he thinks of leaving soon to get married so he offered if i would lend him books out of the library to do what i wished but i preferred giving him my own and that satisfied him better on my second visit linton seemed in lively spirits and zillah that is their housekeeper made us a clean room and a good fire and told us that as joseph was out at a prayer meeting and hareton earnshaw was off with his dogs robbing our woods of pheasants as i heard afterwards we might do what we liked she brought me some warm wine and gingerbread and appeared exceedingly good natured and linton sat in the arm chair and i in the little rocking chair on the hearth stone and we laughed and talked so merrily and found so much to say we planned where we would go and what we would do in summer i neednt repeat that because you would call it silly one time however we were near quarrelling he said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot july day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom and the larks singing high up overhead and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly that was his most perfect idea of heavens happiness mine was rocking in a rustling green tree with a west wind blowing and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above and not only larks but throstles and blackbirds and linnets and cuckoos pouring out music on every side and the moors seen at a distance broken into cool dusky dells but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze and woods and sounding water and the whole world awake and wild with joy he wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace i wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee i said his heaven would be only half alive and he said mine would be drunk i said i should fall asleep in his and he said he could not breathe in mine and began to grow very snappish at last we agreed to try both as soon as the right weather came and then we kissed each other and were friends after sitting still an hour i looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor and thought how nice it would be to play in if we removed the table and i asked linton to call zillah in to help us and wed have a game at blindmans buff she should try to catch us you used to you know ellen he wouldnt there was no pleasure in it he said but he consented to play at ball with me we found two in a cupboard among a heap of old toys tops and hoops and battledores and shuttlecocks one was marked c and the other h i wished to have the c because that stood for catherine and the h might be for heathcliff his name but the bran came out of h and linton didnt like it i beat him constantly and he got cross again and coughed and returned to his chair that night though he easily recovered his good humour he was charmed with two or three pretty songs your songs ellen and when i was obliged to go he begged and entreated me to come the following evening and i promised minny and i went flying home as light as air and i dreamt of wuthering heights and my sweet darling cousin till morning on the morrow i was sad partly because you were poorly and partly that i wished my father knew and approved of my excursions but it was beautiful moonlight after tea and as i rode on the gloom cleared i shall have another happy evening i thought to myself and what delights me more my pretty linton will i trotted up their garden and was turning round to the back when that fellow earnshaw met me took my bridle and bid me go in by the front entrance he patted minnys neck and said she was a bonny beast and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him i only told him to leave my horse alone or else it would kick him he answered in his vulgar accent it wouldnt do mitch hurt if it did and surveyed its legs with a smile i was half inclined to make it try however he moved off to open the door and as he raised the latch he looked up to the inscription above and said with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation miss catherine i can read yon now wonderful i exclaimed pray let us hear you you are grown clever he spelt and drawled over by syllables the name hareton earnshaw and the figures i cried encouragingly perceiving that he came to a dead halt i cannot tell them yet he answered oh you dunce i said laughing heartily at his failure the fool stared with a grin hovering about his lips and a scowl gathering over his eyes as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth whether it were not pleasant familiarity or what it really was contempt i settled his doubts by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away for i came to see linton not him he reddened i saw that by the moonlight dropped his hand from the latch and skulked off a picture of mortified vanity he imagined himself to be as accomplished as linton i suppose because he could spell his own name and was marvellously discomfited that i didnt think the same stop miss catherine dear i interrupted i shall not scold but i dont like your conduct there if you had remembered that hareton was your cousin as much as master heathcliff you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way at least it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as linton and probably he did not learn merely to show off you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before i have no doubt and he wished to remedy it and please you to sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding had you been brought up in his circumstances would you be less rude he was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were and im hurt that he should be despised now because that base heathcliff has treated him so unjustly well ellen you wont cry about it will you she exclaimed surprised at my earnestness but wait and you shall hear if he conned his a b c to please me and if it were worth while being civil to the brute i entered linton was lying on the settle and half got up to welcome me im ill to night catherine love he said and you must have all the talk and let me listen come and sit by me i was sure you wouldnt break your word and ill make you promise again before you go i knew now that i mustnt tease him as he was ill and i spoke softly and put no questions and avoided irritating him in any way i had brought some of my nicest books for him he asked me to read a little of one and i was about to comply when earnshaw burst the door open having gathered venom with reflection he advanced direct to us seized linton by the arm and swung him off the seat get to thy own room he said in a voice almost inarticulate with passion and his face looked swelled and furious take her there if she comes to see thee thou shallnt keep me out of this begone wi ye both he swore at us and left linton no time to answer nearly throwing him into the kitchen and he clenched his fist as i followed seemingly longing to knock me down i was afraid for a moment and i let one volume fall he kicked it after me and shut us out i heard a malignant crackly laugh by the fire and turning beheld that odious joseph standing rubbing his bony hands and quivering i wer sure hed sarve ye out hes a grand lad hes getten t raight sperrit in him he knaws ay he knaws as weel as i do who sud be t maister yonder ech ech ech he made ye skift properly ech ech ech where must we go i asked of my cousin disregarding the old wretchs mockery linton was white and trembling he was not pretty then ellen oh no he looked frightful for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic powerless fury he grasped the handle of the door and shook it it was fastened inside if you dont let me in ill kill you if you dont let me in ill kill you he rather shrieked than said devil devil ill kill you ill kill you joseph uttered his croaking laugh again thear thats t father he cried thats father weve allas summut o either side in us niver heed hareton lad dunnut be feard he cannot get at thee i took hold of lintons hands and tried to pull him away but he shrieked so shockingly that i dared not proceed at last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing blood gushed from his mouth and he fell on the ground i ran into the yard sick with terror and called for zillah as loud as i could she soon heard me she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn and hurrying from her work she inquired what there was to do i hadnt breath to explain dragging her in i looked about for linton earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused and he was then conveying the poor thing upstairs zillah and i ascended after him but he stopped me at the top of the steps and said i shouldnt go in i must go home i exclaimed that he had killed linton and i would enter joseph locked the door and declared i should do no sich stuff and asked me whether i were bahn to be as mad as him i stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared she affirmed he would be better in a bit but he couldnt do with that shrieking and din and she took me and nearly carried me into the house ellen i was ready to tear my hair off my head i sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite presuming every now and then to bid me wisht and denying that it was his fault and finally frightened by my assertions that i would tell papa and that he should be put in prison and hanged he commenced blubbering himself and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation still i was not rid of him when at length they compelled me to depart and i had got some hundred yards off the premises he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road side and checked minny and took hold of me miss catherine im ill grieved he began but its rayther too bad i gave him a cut with my whip thinking perhaps he would murder me he let go thundering one of his horrid curses and i galloped home more than half out of my senses i didnt bid you good night that evening and i didnt go to wuthering heights the next i wished to go exceedingly but i was strangely excited and dreaded to hear that linton was dead sometimes and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering hareton on the third day i took courage at least i couldnt bear longer suspense and stole off once more i went at five oclock and walked fancying i might manage to creep into the house and up to lintons room unobserved however the dogs gave notice of my approach zillah received me and saying the lad was mending nicely showed me into a small tidy carpeted apartment where to my inexpressible joy i beheld linton laid on a little sofa reading one of my books but he would neither speak to me nor look at me through a whole hour ellen he has such an unhappy temper and what quite confounded me when he did open his mouth it was to utter the falsehood that i had occasioned the uproar and hareton was not to blame unable to reply except passionately i got up and walked from the room he sent after me a faint catherine he did not reckon on being answered so but i wouldnt turn back and the morrow was the second day on which i stayed at home nearly determined to visit him no more but it was so miserable going to bed and getting up and never hearing anything about him that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed it had appeared wrong to take the journey once now it seemed wrong to refrain michael came to ask if he must saddle minny i said yes and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills i was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court it was no use trying to conceal my presence young master is in the house said zillah as she saw me making for the parlour i went in earnshaw was there also but he quitted the room directly linton sat in the great arm chair half asleep walking up to the fire i began in a serious tone partly meaning it to be true as you dont like me linton and as you think i come on purpose to hurt you and pretend that i do so every time this is our last meeting let us say good bye and tell mr heathcliff that you have no wish to see me and that he mustnt invent any more falsehoods on the subject sit down and take your hat off catherine he answered you are so much happier than i am you ought to be better papa talks enough of my defects and shows enough scorn of me to make it natural i should doubt myself i doubt whether i am not altogether as worthless as he calls me frequently and then i feel so cross and bitter i hate everybody i am worthless and bad in temper and bad in spirit almost always and if you choose you may say good bye youll get rid of an annoyance only catherine do me this justice believe that if i might be as sweet and as kind and as good as you are i would be as willingly and more so than as happy and as healthy and believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love and though i couldnt and cannot help showing my nature to you i regret it and repent it and shall regret and repent it till i die i felt he spoke the truth and i felt i must forgive him and though we should quarrel the next moment i must forgive him again we were reconciled but we cried both of us the whole time i stayed not entirely for sorrow yet i was sorry linton had that distorted nature hell never let his friends be at ease and hell never be at ease himself i have always gone to his little parlour since that night because his father returned the day after about three times i think we have been merry and hopeful as we were the first evening the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled now with his selfishness and spite and now with his sufferings but ive learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter mr heathcliff purposely avoids me i have hardly seen him at all last sunday indeed coming earlier than usual i heard him abusing poor linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before i cant tell how he knew of it unless he listened linton had certainly behaved provokingly however it was the business of nobody but me and i interrupted mr heathcliffs lecture by entering and telling him so he burst into a laugh and went away saying he was glad i took that view of the matter since then ive told linton he must whisper his bitter things now ellen you have heard all i cant be prevented from going to wuthering heights except by inflicting misery on two people whereas if youll only not tell papa my going need disturb the tranquillity of none youll not tell will you it will be very heartless if you do ill make up my mind on that point by to morrow miss catherine i replied it requires some study and so ill leave you to your rest and go think it over i thought it over aloud in my masters presence walking straight from her room to his and relating the whole story with the exception of her conversations with her cousin and any mention of hareton mr linton was alarmed and distressed more than he would acknowledge to me in the morning catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end in vain she wept and writhed against the interdict and implored her father to have pity on linton all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the grange when he pleased but explaining that he must no longer expect to see catherine at wuthering heights perhaps had he been aware of his nephews disposition and state of health he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation
