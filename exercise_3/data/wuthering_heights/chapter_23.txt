the rainy night had ushered in a misty morning half frost half drizzle and temporary brooks crossed our path gurgling from the uplands my feet were thoroughly wetted i was cross and low exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things we entered the farm house by the kitchen way to ascertain whether mr heathcliff were really absent because i put slight faith in his own affirmation joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone beside a roaring fire a quart of ale on the table near him bristling with large pieces of toasted oat cake and his black short pipe in his mouth catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself i asked if the master was in my question remained so long unanswered that i thought the old man had grown deaf and repeated it louder na ay he snarled or rather screamed through his nose na ay yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough joseph cried a peevish voice simultaneously with me from the inner room how often am i to call you there are only a few red ashes now joseph come this moment vigorous puffs and a resolute stare into the grate declared he had no ear for this appeal the housekeeper and hareton were invisible one gone on an errand and the other at his work probably we knew lintons tones and entered oh i hope youll die in a garret starved to death said the boy mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant he stopped on observing his error his cousin flew to him is that you miss linton he said raising his head from the arm of the great chair in which he reclined no dont kiss me it takes my breath dear me papa said you would call continued he after recovering a little from catherines embrace while she stood by looking very contrite will you shut the door if you please you left it open and those those detestable creatures wont bring coals to the fire its so cold i stirred up the cinders and fetched a scuttleful myself the invalid complained of being covered with ashes but he had a tiresome cough and looked feverish and ill so i did not rebuke his temper well linton murmured catherine when his corrugated brow relaxed are you glad to see me can i do you any good why didnt you come before he asked you should have come instead of writing it tired me dreadfully writing those long letters id far rather have talked to you now i can neither bear to talk nor anything else i wonder where zillah is will you looking at me step into the kitchen and see i had received no thanks for my other service and being unwilling to run to and fro at his behest i replied nobody is out there but joseph i want to drink he exclaimed fretfully turning away zillah is constantly gadding off to gimmerton since papa went its miserable and im obliged to come down here they resolved never to hear me upstairs is your father attentive to you master heathcliff i asked perceiving catherine to be checked in her friendly advances attentive he makes them a little more attentive at least he cried the wretches do you know miss linton that brute hareton laughs at me i hate him indeed i hate them all they are odious beings cathy began searching for some water she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser filled a tumbler and brought it he bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table and having swallowed a small portion appeared more tranquil and said she was very kind and are you glad to see me asked she reiterating her former question and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile yes i am its something new to hear a voice like yours he replied but i have been vexed because you wouldnt come and papa swore it was owing to me he called me a pitiful shuffling worthless thing and said you despised me and if he had been in my place he would be more the master of the grange than your father by this time but you dont despise me do you miss i wish you would say catherine or cathy interrupted my young lady despise you no next to papa and ellen i love you better than anybody living i dont love mr heathcliff though and i dare not come when he returns will he stay away many days not many answered linton but he goes on to the moors frequently since the shooting season commenced and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence do say you will i think i should not be peevish with you youd not provoke me and youd always be ready to help me wouldnt you yes said catherine stroking his long soft hair if i could only get papas consent id spend half my time with you pretty linton i wish you were my brother and then you would like me as well as your father observed he more cheerfully but papa says you would love me better than him and all the world if you were my wife so id rather you were that no i should never love anybody better than papa she returned gravely and people hate their wives sometimes but not their sisters and brothers and if you were the latter you would live with us and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me linton denied that people ever hated their wives but cathy affirmed they did and in her wisdom instanced his own fathers aversion to her aunt i endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue i couldnt succeed till everything she knew was out master heathcliff much irritated asserted her relation was false papa told me and papa does not tell falsehoods she answered pertly my papa scorns yours cried linton he calls him a sneaking fool yours is a wicked man retorted catherine and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says he must be wicked to have made aunt isabella leave him as she did she didnt leave him said the boy you shant contradict me she did cried my young lady well ill tell you something said linton your mother hated your father now then oh exclaimed catherine too enraged to continue and she loved mine added he you little liar i hate you now she panted and her face grew red with passion she did she did sang linton sinking into the recess of his chair and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant who stood behind hush master heathcliff i said thats your fathers tale too i suppose it isnt you hold your tongue he answered she did she did catherine she did she did cathy beside herself gave the chair a violent push and caused him to fall against one arm he was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph it lasted so long that it frightened even me as to his cousin she wept with all her might aghast at the mischief she had done though she said nothing i held him till the fit exhausted itself then he thrust me away and leant his head down silently catherine quelled her lamentations also took a seat opposite and looked solemnly into the fire how do you feel now master heathcliff i inquired after waiting ten minutes i wish she felt as i do he replied spiteful cruel thing hareton never touches me he never struck me in his life and i was better to day and there his voice died in a whimper i didnt strike you muttered cathy chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion he sighed and moaned like one under great suffering and kept it up for a quarter of an hour on purpose to distress his cousin apparently for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflexions of his voice im sorry i hurt you linton she said at length racked beyond endurance but i couldnt have been hurt by that little push and i had no idea that you could either youre not much are you linton dont let me go home thinking ive done you harm answer speak to me i cant speak to you he murmured youve hurt me so that i shall lie awake all night choking with this cough if you had it youd know what it was but youll be comfortably asleep while im in agony and nobody near me i wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights and he began to wail aloud for very pity of himself since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights i said it wont be miss who spoils your ease youd be the same had she never come however she shall not disturb you again and perhaps youll get quieter when we leave you must i go asked catherine dolefully bending over him do you want me to go linton you cant alter what youve done he replied pettishly shrinking from her unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever well then i must go she repeated let me alone at least said he i cant bear your talking she lingered and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while but as he neither looked up nor spoke she finally made a movement to the door and i followed we were recalled by a scream linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can i thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him not so my companion she ran back in terror knelt down and cried and soothed and entreated till he grew quiet from lack of breath by no means from compunction at distressing her i shall lift him on to the settle i said and he may roll about as he pleases we cant stop to watch him i hope you are satisfied miss cathy that you are not the person to benefit him and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you now then there he is come away as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense hell be glad to lie still she placed a cushion under his head and offered him some water he rejected the latter and tossed uneasily on the former as if it were a stone or a block of wood she tried to put it more comfortably i cant do with that he said its not high enough catherine brought another to lay above it thats too high murmured the provoking thing how must i arrange it then she asked despairingly he twined himself up to her as she half knelt by the settle and converted her shoulder into a support no that wont do i said youll be content with the cushion master heathcliff miss has wasted too much time on you already we cannot remain five minutes longer yes yes we can replied cathy hes good and patient now hes beginning to think i shall have far greater misery than he will to night if i believe he is the worse for my visit and then i dare not come again tell the truth about it linton for i mustnt come if i have hurt you you must come to cure me he answered you ought to come because you have hurt me you know you have extremely i was not as ill when you entered as i am at present was i but youve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion i didnt do it all said his cousin however well be friends now and you want me you would wish to see me sometimes really i told you i did he replied impatiently sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee thats as mamma used to do whole afternoons together sit quite still and dont talk but you may sing a song if you can sing or you may say a nice long interesting ballad one of those you promised to teach me or a story id rather have a ballad though begin catherine repeated the longest she could remember the employment pleased both mightily linton would have another and after that another notwithstanding my strenuous objections and so they went on until the clock struck twelve and we heard hareton in the court returning for his dinner and to morrow catherine will you be here to morrow asked young heathcliff holding her frock as she rose reluctantly no i answered nor next day neither she however gave a different response evidently for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear you wont go to morrow recollect miss i commenced when we were out of the house you are not dreaming of it are you she smiled oh ill take good care i continued ill have that lock mended and you can escape by no way else i can get over the wall she said laughing the grange is not a prison ellen and you are not my gaoler and besides im almost seventeen im a woman and im certain linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him im older than he is you know and wiser less childish am i not and hell soon do as i direct him with some slight coaxing hes a pretty little darling when hes good id make such a pet of him if he were mine we should never quarrel should we after we were used to each other dont you like him ellen like him i exclaimed the worst tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens happily as mr heathcliff conjectured hell not win twenty i doubt whether hell see spring indeed and small loss to his family whenever he drops off and lucky it is for us that his father took him the kinder he was treated the more tedious and selfish hed be im glad you have no chance of having him for a husband miss catherine my companion waxed serious at hearing this speech to speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings hes younger than i she answered after a protracted pause of meditation and he ought to live the longest he will he must live as long as i do hes as strong now as when he first came into the north im positive of that its only a cold that ails him the same as papa has you say papa will get better and why shouldnt he well well i cried after all we neednt trouble ourselves for listen miss and mind ill keep my word if you attempt going to wuthering heights again with or without me i shall inform mr linton and unless he allow it the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived it has been revived muttered cathy sulkily must not be continued then i said well see was her reply and she set off at a gallop leaving me to toil in the rear we both reached home before our dinner time my master supposed we had been wandering through the park and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence as soon as i entered i hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings but sitting such a while at the heights had done the mischief on the succeeding morning i was laid up and during three weeks i remained incapacitated for attending to my duties a calamity never experienced prior to that period and never i am thankful to say since my little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me and cheer my solitude the confinement brought me exceedingly low it is wearisome to a stirring active body but few have slighter reasons for complaint than i had the moment catherine left mr lintons room she appeared at my bedside her day was divided between us no amusement usurped a minute she neglected her meals her studies and her play and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched she must have had a warm heart when she loved her father so to give so much to me i said her days were divided between us but the master retired early and i generally needed nothing after six oclock thus the evening was her own poor thing i never considered what she did with herself after tea and though frequently when she looked in to bid me good night i remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors i laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library
