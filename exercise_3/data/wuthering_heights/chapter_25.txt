summer was already past its prime when edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to their entreaties and catherine and i set out on our first ride to join her cousin it was a close sultry day devoid of sunshine but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain and our place of meeting had been fixed at the guide stone by the cross roads on arriving there however a little herd boy despatched as a messenger told us that maister linton wer just o this side th heights and hed be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further then master linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle i observed he bid us keep on the grange land and here we are off at once well well turn our horses heads round when we reach him answered my companion our excursion shall lie towards home but when we reached him and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own door we found he had no horse and we were forced to dismount and leave ours to graze he lay on the heath awaiting our approach and did not rise till we came within a few yards then he walked so feebly and looked so pale that i immediately exclaimed why master heathcliff you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning how ill you do look catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment she changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm and the congratulation on their long postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry whether he were worse than usual no better better he panted trembling and retaining her hand as if he needed its support while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they once possessed but you have been worse persisted his cousin worse than when i saw you last you are thinner and im tired he interrupted hurriedly it is too hot for walking let us rest here and in the morning i often feel sick papa says i grow so fast badly satisfied cathy sat down and he reclined beside her this is something like your paradise said she making an effort at cheerfulness you recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest this is nearly yours only there are clouds but then they are so soft and mellow it is nicer than sunshine next week if you can well ride down to the grange park and try mine linton did not appear to remember what she talked of and he had evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation his lack of interest in the subjects she started and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment an indefinite alteration had come over his whole person and manner the pettishness that might be caressed into fondness had yielded to a listless apathy there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed and more of the self absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid repelling consolation and ready to regard the good humoured mirth of others as an insult catherine perceived as well as i did that he held it rather a punishment than a gratification to endure our company and she made no scruple of proposing presently to depart that proposal unexpectedly roused linton from his lethargy and threw him into a strange state of agitation he glanced fearfully towards the heights begging she would remain another half hour at least but i think said cathy youd be more comfortable at home than sitting here and i cannot amuse you to day i see by my tales and songs and chatter you have grown wiser than i in these six months you have little taste for my diversions now or else if i could amuse you id willingly stay stay to rest yourself he replied and catherine dont think or say that im very unwell it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull and i walked about before you came a great deal for me tell uncle im in tolerable health will you ill tell him that you say so linton i couldnt affirm that you are observed my young lady wondering at his pertinacious assertion of what was evidently an untruth and be here again next thursday continued he shunning her puzzled gaze and give him my thanks for permitting you to come my best thanks catherine and and if you did meet my father and he asked you about me dont lead him to suppose that ive been extremely silent and stupid dont look sad and downcast as you are doing hell be angry i care nothing for his anger exclaimed cathy imagining she would be its object but i do said her cousin shuddering dont provoke him against me catherine for he is very hard is he severe to you master heathcliff i inquired has he grown weary of indulgence and passed from passive to active hatred linton looked at me but did not answer and after keeping her seat by his side another ten minutes during which his head fell drowsily on his breast and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries and sharing the produce of her researches with me she did not offer them to him for she saw further notice would only weary and annoy is it half an hour now ellen she whispered in my ear at last i cant tell why we should stay hes asleep and papa will be wanting us back well we must not leave him asleep i answered wait till he wakes and be patient you were mighty eager to set off but your longing to see poor linton has soon evaporated why did he wish to see me returned catherine in his crossest humours formerly i liked him better than i do in his present curious mood its just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform this interview for fear his father should scold him but im hardly going to come to give mr heathcliff pleasure whatever reason he may have for ordering linton to undergo this penance and though im glad hes better in health im sorry hes so much less pleasant and so much less affectionate to me you think he is better in health then i said yes she answered because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings you know he is not tolerably well as he told me to tell papa but hes better very likely there you differ with me miss cathy i remarked i should conjecture him to be far worse linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror and asked if any one had called his name no said catherine unless in dreams i cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of doors in the morning i thought i heard my father he gasped glancing up to the frowning nab above us you are sure nobody spoke quite sure replied his cousin only ellen and i were disputing concerning your health are you truly stronger linton than when we separated in winter if you be im certain one thing is not stronger your regard for me speak are you the tears gushed from lintons eyes as he answered yes yes i am and still under the spell of the imaginary voice his gaze wandered up and down to detect its owner cathy rose for to day we must part she said and i wont conceal that i have been sadly disappointed with our meeting though ill mention it to nobody but you not that i stand in awe of mr heathcliff hush murmured linton for gods sake hush hes coming and he clung to catherines arm striving to detain her but at that announcement she hastily disengaged herself and whistled to minny who obeyed her like a dog ill be here next thursday she cried springing to the saddle good bye quick ellen and so we left him scarcely conscious of our departure so absorbed was he in anticipating his fathers approach before we reached home catherines displeasure softened into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret largely blended with vague uneasy doubts about lintons actual circumstances physical and social in which i partook though i counselled her not to say much for a second journey would make us better judges my master requested an account of our ongoings his nephews offering of thanks was duly delivered miss cathy gently touching on the rest i also threw little light on his inquiries for i hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal
