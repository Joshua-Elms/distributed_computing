a charming introduction to a hermits life four weeks torture tossing and sickness oh these bleak winds and bitter northern skies and impassable roads and dilatory country surgeons and oh this dearth of the human physiognomy and worse than all the terrible intimation of kenneth that i need not expect to be out of doors till spring mr heathcliff has just honoured me with a call about seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse the last of the season scoundrel he is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine and that i had a great mind to tell him but alas how could i offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts blisters and leeches this is quite an easy interval i am too weak to read yet i feel as if i could enjoy something interesting why not have up mrs dean to finish her tale i can recollect its chief incidents as far as she had gone yes i remember her hero had run off and never been heard of for three years and the heroine was married ill ring shell be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully mrs dean came it wants twenty minutes sir to taking the medicine she commenced away away with it i replied i desire to have the doctor says you must drop the powders with all my heart dont interrupt me come and take your seat here keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials draw your knitting out of your pocket that will do now continue the history of mr heathcliff from where you left off to the present day did he finish his education on the continent and come back a gentleman or did he get a sizars place at college or escape to america and earn honours by drawing blood from his foster country or make a fortune more promptly on the english highways he may have done a little in all these vocations mr lockwood but i couldnt give my word for any i stated before that i didnt know how he gained his money neither am i aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk but with your leave ill proceed in my own fashion if you think it will amuse and not weary you are you feeling better this morning much thats good news * * * * * i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange and to my agreeable disappointment she behaved infinitely better than i dared to expect she seemed almost over fond of mr linton and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection they were both very attentive to her comfort certainly it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn there were no mutual concessions one stood erect and the others yielded and who can be ill natured and bad tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference i observed that mr edgar had a deep rooted fear of ruffling her humour he concealed it from her but if ever he heard me answer sharply or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed not to grieve a kind master i learned to be less touchy and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand because no fire came near to explode it catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution produced by her perilous illness as she was never subject to depression of spirits before the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness it ended well we must be for ourselves in the long run the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the ones interest was not the chief consideration in the others thoughts on a mellow evening in september i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering it had got dusk and the moon looked over the high wall of the court causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building i set my burden on the house steps by the kitchen door and lingered to rest and drew in a few more breaths of the soft sweet air my eyes were on the moon and my back to the entrance when i heard a voice behind me say nelly is that you it was a deep voice and foreign in tone yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar i turned about to discover who spoke fearfully for the doors were shut and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps something stirred in the porch and moving nearer i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes with dark face and hair he leant against the side and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself who can it be i thought mr earnshaw oh no the voice has no resemblance to his i have waited here an hour he resumed while i continued staring and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death i dared not enter you do not know me look im not a stranger a ray fell on his features the cheeks were sallow and half covered with black whiskers the brows lowering the eyes deep set and singular i remembered the eyes what i cried uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor and i raised my hands in amazement what you come back is it really you is it yes heathcliff he replied glancing from me up to the windows which reflected a score of glittering moons but showed no lights from within are they at home where is she nelly you are not glad you neednt be so disturbed is she here speak i want to have one word with her your mistress go and say some person from gimmerton desires to see her how will she take it i exclaimed what will she do the surprise bewilders me it will put her out of her head and you are heathcliff but altered nay theres no comprehending it have you been for a soldier go and carry my message he interrupted impatiently im in hell till you do he lifted the latch and i entered but when i got to the parlour where mr and mrs linton were i could not persuade myself to proceed at length i resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted and i opened the door they sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall and displayed beyond the garden trees and the wild green park the valley of gimmerton with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top for very soon after you pass the chapel as you may have noticed the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen wuthering heights rose above this silvery vapour but our old house was invisible it rather dips down on the other side both the room and its occupants and the scene they gazed on looked wondrously peaceful i shrank reluctantly from performing my errand and was actually going away leaving it unsaid after having put my question about the candles when a sense of my folly compelled me to return and mutter a person from gimmerton wishes to see you maam what does he want asked mrs linton i did not question him i answered well close the curtains nelly she said and bring up tea ill be back again directly she quitted the apartment mr edgar inquired carelessly who it was some one mistress does not expect i replied that heathcliff you recollect him sir who used to live at mr earnshaws what the gipsy the ploughboy he cried why did you not say so to catherine hush you must not call him by those names master i said shed be sadly grieved to hear you she was nearly heartbroken when he ran off i guess his return will make a jubilee to her mr linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court he unfastened it and leant out i suppose they were below for he exclaimed quickly dont stand there love bring the person in if it be anyone particular ere long i heard the click of the latch and catherine flew upstairs breathless and wild too excited to show gladness indeed by her face you would rather have surmised an awful calamity oh edgar edgar she panted flinging her arms round his neck oh edgar darling heathcliffs come back he is and she tightened her embrace to a squeeze well well cried her husband crossly dont strangle me for that he never struck me as such a marvellous treasure there is no need to be frantic i know you didnt like him she answered repressing a little the intensity of her delight yet for my sake you must be friends now shall i tell him to come up here he said into the parlour where else she asked he looked vexed and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him mrs linton eyed him with a droll expression half angry half laughing at his fastidiousness no she added after a while i cannot sit in the kitchen set two tables here ellen one for your master and miss isabella being gentry the other for heathcliff and myself being of the lower orders will that please you dear or must i have a fire lighted elsewhere if so give directions ill run down and secure my guest im afraid the joy is too great to be real she was about to dart off again but edgar arrested her you bid him step up he said addressing me and catherine try to be glad without being absurd the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother i descended and found heathcliff waiting under the porch evidently anticipating an invitation to enter he followed my guidance without waste of words and i ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking but the ladys glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door she sprang forward took both his hands and led him to linton and then she seized lintons reluctant fingers and crushed them into his now fully revealed by the fire and candlelight i was amazed more than ever to behold the transformation of heathcliff he had grown a tall athletic well formed man beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youth like his upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army his countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than mr lintons it looked intelligent and retained no marks of former degradation a half civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire but it was subdued and his manner was even dignified quite divested of roughness though too stern for grace my masters surprise equalled or exceeded mine he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy as he had called him heathcliff dropped his slight hand and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak sit down sir he said at length mrs linton recalling old times would have me give you a cordial reception and of course i am gratified when anything occurs to please her and i also answered heathcliff especially if it be anything in which i have a part i shall stay an hour or two willingly he took a seat opposite catherine who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it he did not raise his to her often a quick glance now and then sufficed but it flashed back each time more confidently the undisguised delight he drank from hers they were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment not so mr edgar he grew pale with pure annoyance a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose and stepping across the rug seized heathcliffs hands again and laughed like one beside herself i shall think it a dream to morrow she cried i shall not be able to believe that i have seen and touched and spoken to you once more and yet cruel heathcliff you dont deserve this welcome to be absent and silent for three years and never to think of me a little more than you have thought of me he murmured i heard of your marriage cathy not long since and while waiting in the yard below i meditated this plan just to have one glimpse of your face a stare of surprise perhaps and pretended pleasure afterwards settle my score with hindley and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time nay youll not drive me off again you were really sorry for me were you well there was cause ive fought through a bitter life since i last heard your voice and you must forgive me for i struggled only for you catherine unless we are to have cold tea please to come to the table interrupted linton striving to preserve his ordinary tone and a due measure of politeness mr heathcliff will have a long walk wherever he may lodge to night and im thirsty she took her post before the urn and miss isabella came summoned by the bell then having handed their chairs forward i left the room the meal hardly endured ten minutes catherines cup was never filled she could neither eat nor drink edgar had made a slop in his saucer and scarcely swallowed a mouthful their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer i asked as he departed if he went to gimmerton no to wuthering heights he answered mr earnshaw invited me when i called this morning mr earnshaw invited him and he called on mr earnshaw i pondered this sentence painfully after he was gone is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak i mused i had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away about the middle of the night i was wakened from my first nap by mrs linton gliding into my chamber taking a seat on my bedside and pulling me by the hair to rouse me i cannot rest ellen she said by way of apology and i want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness edgar is sulky because im glad of a thing that does not interest him he refuses to open his mouth except to utter pettish silly speeches and he affirmed i was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy he always contrives to be sick at the least cross i gave a few sentences of commendation to heathcliff and he either for a headache or a pang of envy began to cry so i got up and left him what use is it praising heathcliff to him i answered as lads they had an aversion to each other and heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised its human nature let mr linton alone about him unless you would like an open quarrel between them but does it not show great weakness pursued she im not envious i never feel hurt at the brightness of isabellas yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin at her dainty elegance and the fondness all the family exhibit for her even you nelly if we have a dispute sometimes you back isabella at once and i yield like a foolish mother i call her a darling and flatter her into a good temper it pleases her brother to see us cordial and that pleases me but they are very much alike they are spoiled children and fancy the world was made for their accommodation and though i humour both i think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same youre mistaken mrs linton said i they humour you i know what there would be to do if they did not you can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires you may however fall out at last over something of equal consequence to both sides and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you and then we shall fight to the death shant we nelly she returned laughing no i tell you i have such faith in lintons love that i believe i might kill him and he wouldnt wish to retaliate i advised her to value him the more for his affection i do she answered but he neednt resort to whining for trifles it is childish and instead of melting into tears because i said that heathcliff was now worthy of anyones regard and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend he ought to have said it for me and been delighted from sympathy he must get accustomed to him and he may as well like him considering how heathcliff has reason to object to him im sure he behaved excellently what do you think of his going to wuthering heights i inquired he is reformed in every respect apparently quite a christian offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around he explained it she replied i wonder as much as you he said he called to gather information concerning me from you supposing you resided there still and joseph told hindley who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing and how he had been living and finally desired him to walk in there were some persons sitting at cards heathcliff joined them my brother lost some money to him and finding him plentifully supplied he requested that he would come again in the evening to which he consented hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently he doesnt trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured but heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the grange and an attachment to the house where we lived together and likewise a hope that i shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than i could have if he settled in gimmerton he means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the heights and doubtless my brothers covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms he was always greedy though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other its a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in said i have you no fear of the consequences mrs linton none for my friend she replied his strong head will keep him from danger a little for hindley but he cant be made morally worse than he is and i stand between him and bodily harm the event of this evening has reconciled me to god and humanity i had risen in angry rebellion against providence oh ive endured very very bitter misery nelly if that creature knew how bitter hed be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance it was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone had i expressed the agony i frequently felt he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as i however its over and ill take no revenge on his folly i can afford to suffer anything hereafter should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek id not only turn the other but id ask pardon for provoking it and as a proof ill go make my peace with edgar instantly good night im an angel in this self complacent conviction she departed and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow mr linton had not only abjured his peevishness though his spirits seemed still subdued by catherines exuberance of vivacity but he ventured no objection to her taking isabella with her to wuthering heights in the afternoon and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine heathcliff mr heathcliff i should say in future used the liberty of visiting at thrushcross grange cautiously at first he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion catherine also deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him and he gradually established his right to be expected he retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling my masters uneasiness experienced a lull and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space his new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of isabella linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest she was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen infantile in manners though possessed of keen wit keen feelings and a keen temper too if irritated her brother who loved her tenderly was appalled at this fantastic preference leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man and the possible fact that his property in default of heirs male might pass into such a ones power he had sense to comprehend heathcliffs disposition to know that though his exterior was altered his mind was unchangeable and unchanged and he dreaded that mind it revolted him he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing isabella to its keeping he would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on heathcliffs deliberate designing we had all remarked during some time that miss linton fretted and pined over something she grew cross and wearisome snapping at and teasing catherine continually at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience we excused her to a certain extent on the plea of ill health she was dwindling and fading before our eyes but one day when she had been peculiarly wayward rejecting her breakfast complaining that the servants did not do what she told them that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house and edgar neglected her that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations mrs linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed and having scolded her heartily threatened to send for the doctor mention of kenneth caused her to exclaim instantly that her health was perfect and it was only catherines harshness which made her unhappy how can you say i am harsh you naughty fondling cried the mistress amazed at the unreasonable assertion you are surely losing your reason when have i been harsh tell me yesterday sobbed isabella and now yesterday said her sister in law on what occasion in our walk along the moor you told me to ramble where i pleased while you sauntered on with mr heathcliff and thats your notion of harshness said catherine laughing it was no hint that your company was superfluous we didnt care whether you kept with us or not i merely thought heathcliffs talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears oh no wept the young lady you wished me away because you knew i liked to be there is she sane asked mrs linton appealing to me ill repeat our conversation word for word isabella and you point out any charm it could have had for you i dont mind the conversation she answered i wanted to be with well said catherine perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence with him and i wont be always sent off she continued kindling up you are a dog in the manger cathy and desire no one to be loved but yourself you are an impertinent little monkey exclaimed mrs linton in surprise but ill not believe this idiocy it is impossible that you can covet the admiration of heathcliff that you consider him an agreeable person i hope i have misunderstood you isabella no you have not said the infatuated girl i love him more than ever you loved edgar and he might love me if you would let him i wouldnt be you for a kingdom then catherine declared emphatically and she seemed to speak sincerely nelly help me to convince her of her madness tell her what heathcliff is an unreclaimed creature without refinement without cultivation an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone id as soon put that little canary into the park on a winters day as recommend you to bestow your heart on him it is deplorable ignorance of his character child and nothing else which makes that dream enter your head pray dont imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior hes not a rough diamond a pearl containing oyster of a rustic hes a fierce pitiless wolfish man i never say to him let this or that enemy alone because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them i say let them alone because i should hate them to be wronged and hed crush you like a sparrows egg isabella if he found you a troublesome charge i know he couldnt love a linton and yet hed be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations avarice is growing with him a besetting sin theres my picture and im his friend so much so that had he thought seriously to catch you i should perhaps have held my tongue and let you fall into his trap miss linton regarded her sister in law with indignation for shame for shame she repeated angrily you are worse than twenty foes you poisonous friend ah you wont believe me then said catherine you think i speak from wicked selfishness im certain you do retorted isabella and i shudder at you good cried the other try for yourself if that be your spirit i have done and yield the argument to your saucy insolence and i must suffer for her egotism she sobbed as mrs linton left the room all all is against me she has blighted my single consolation but she uttered falsehoods didnt she mr heathcliff is not a fiend he has an honourable soul and a true one or how could he remember her banish him from your thoughts miss i said hes a bird of bad omen no mate for you mrs linton spoke strongly and yet i cant contradict her she is better acquainted with his heart than i or any one besides and she never would represent him as worse than he is honest people dont hide their deeds how has he been living how has he got rich why is he staying at wuthering heights the house of a man whom he abhors they say mr earnshaw is worse and worse since he came they sit up all night together continually and hindley has been borrowing money on his land and does nothing but play and drink i heard only a week ago it was joseph who told me i met him at gimmerton nelly he said wes hae a crowners quest enow at ahr folks one on em s amost getten his finger cut off wi hauding t other fro stickin hisseln loike a cawlf thats maister yah knaw at s soa up o going tuh t grand

can caint his brass un ate un sleep un off to his neighbours to gossip wi t wife i course he tells dame catherine how her fathurs goold runs into his pocket and her fathurs son gallops down t broad road while he flees afore to oppen t pikes now miss linton joseph is an old rascal but no liar and if his account of heathcliffs conduct be true you would never think of desiring such a husband would you you are leagued with the rest ellen she replied ill not listen to your slanders what malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself or persevered in nursing it perpetually i cannot say she had little time to reflect the day after there was a justice meeting at the next town my master was obliged to attend and mr heathcliff aware of his absence called rather earlier than usual catherine and isabella were sitting in the library on hostile terms but silent the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion the former on mature consideration really offended with her companion and if she laughed again at her pertness inclined to make it no laughing matter to her she did laugh as she saw heathcliff pass the window i was sweeping the hearth and i noticed a mischievous smile on her lips isabella absorbed in her meditations or a book remained till the door opened and it was too late to attempt an escape which she would gladly have done had it been practicable come in thats right exclaimed the mistress gaily pulling a chair to the fire here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them and you are the very one we should both of us choose heathcliff im proud to show you at last somebody that dotes on you more than myself i expect you to feel flattered nay its not nelly dont look at her my poor little sister in law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty it lies in your own power to be edgars brother no no isabella you shant run off she continued arresting with feigned playfulness the confounded girl who had risen indignantly we were quarrelling like cats about you heathcliff and i was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration and moreover i was informed that if i would but have the manners to stand aside my rival as she will have herself to be would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever and send my image into eternal oblivion catherine said isabella calling up her dignity and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her id thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me even in joke mr heathcliff be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me she forgets that you and i are not intimate acquaintances and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression as the guest answered nothing but took his seat and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor by no means cried mrs linton in answer i wont be named a dog in the manger again you shall stay now then heathcliff why dont you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news isabella swears that the love edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you im sure she made some speech of the kind did she not ellen and she has fasted ever since the day before yesterdays walk from sorrow and rage that i despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable i think you belie her said heathcliff twisting his chair to face them she wishes to be out of my society now at any rate and he stared hard at the object of discourse as one might do at a strange repulsive animal a centipede from the indies for instance which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises the poor thing couldnt bear that she grew white and red in rapid succession and while tears beaded her lashes bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of catherine and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down and she could not remove the whole together she began to make use of her nails and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainers with crescents of red theres a tigress exclaimed mrs linton setting her free and shaking her hand with pain begone for gods sake and hide your vixen face how foolish to reveal those talons to him cant you fancy the conclusions hell draw look heathcliff they are instruments that will do execution you must beware of your eyes id wrench them off her fingers if they ever menaced me he answered brutally when the door had closed after her but what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner cathy you were not speaking the truth were you i assure you i was she returned she has been dying for your sake several weeks and raving about you this morning and pouring forth a deluge of abuse because i represented your failings in a plain light for the purpose of mitigating her adoration but dont notice it further i wished to punish her sauciness thats all i like her too well my dear heathcliff to let you absolutely seize and devour her up and i like her too ill to attempt it said he except in a very ghoulish fashion youd hear of odd things if i lived alone with that mawkish waxen face the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow and turning the blue eyes black every day or two they detestably resemble lintons delectably observed catherine they are doves eyes angels shes her brothers heir is she not he asked after a brief silence i should be sorry to think so returned his companion half a dozen nephews shall erase her title please heaven abstract your mind from the subject at present you are too prone to covet your neighbours goods remember this neighbours goods are mine if they were mine they would be none the less that said heathcliff but though isabella linton may be silly she is scarcely mad and in short well dismiss the matter as you advise from their tongues they did dismiss it and catherine probably from her thoughts the other i felt certain recalled it often in the course of the evening i saw him smile to himself grin rather and lapse into ominous musing whenever mrs linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment i determined to watch his movements my heart invariably cleaved to the masters in preference to catherines side with reason i imagined for he was kind and trustful and honourable and she she could not be called the opposite yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude that i had little faith in her principles and still less sympathy for her feelings i wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both wuthering heights and the grange of mr heathcliff quietly leaving us as we had been prior to his advent his visits were a continual nightmare to me and i suspected to my master also his abode at the heights was an oppression past explaining i felt that god had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold waiting his time to spring and destroy
