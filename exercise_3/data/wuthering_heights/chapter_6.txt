mr hindley came home to the funeral and a thing that amazed us and set the neighbours gossiping right and left he brought a wife with him what she was and where she was born he never informed us probably she had neither money nor name to recommend her or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father she was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account every object she saw the moment she crossed the threshold appeared to delight her and every circumstance that took place about her except the preparing for the burial and the presence of the mourners i thought she was half silly from her behaviour while that went on she ran into her chamber and made me come with her though i should have been dressing the children and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands and asking repeatedly are they gone yet then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black and started and trembled and at last fell a weeping and when i asked what was the matter answered she didnt know but she felt so afraid of dying i imagined her as little likely to die as myself she was rather thin but young and fresh complexioned and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds i did remark to be sure that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes but i knew nothing of what these symptoms portended and had no impulse to sympathise with her we dont in general take to foreigners here mr lockwood unless they take to us first young earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence he had grown sparer and lost his colour and spoke and dressed quite differently and on the very day of his return he told joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back kitchen and leave the house for him indeed he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace at the pewter dishes and delf case and dog kennel and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort and so dropped the intention she expressed pleasure too at finding a sister among her new acquaintance and she prattled to catherine and kissed her and ran about with her and gave her quantities of presents at the beginning her affection tired very soon however and when she grew peevish hindley became tyrannical a few words from her evincing a dislike to heathcliff were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy he drove him from their company to the servants deprived him of the instructions of the curate and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first because cathy taught him what she learnt and worked or played with him in the fields they both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved and what they did so they kept clear of him he would not even have seen after their going to church on sundays only joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves and that reminded him to order heathcliff a flogging and catherine a fast from dinner or supper but it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at the curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for catherine to get by heart and joseph might thrash heathcliff till his arm ached they forgot everything the minute they were together again at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge and many a time ive cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily and i not daring to speak a syllable for fear of losing the small power i still retained over the unfriended creatures one sunday evening it chanced that they were banished from the sitting room for making a noise or a light offence of the kind and when i went to call them to supper i could discover them nowhere we searched the house above and below and the yard and stables they were invisible and at last hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors and swore nobody should let them in that night the household went to bed and i too anxious to lie down opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken though it rained determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition should they return in a while i distinguished steps coming up the road and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate i threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking mr earnshaw by knocking there was heathcliff by himself it gave me a start to see him alone where is miss catherine i cried hurriedly no accident i hope at thrushcross grange he answered and i would have been there too but they had not the manners to ask me to stay well you will catch it i said youll never be content till youre sent about your business what in the world led you wandering to thrushcross grange let me get off my wet clothes and ill tell you all about it nelly he replied i bid him beware of rousing the master and while he undressed and i waited to put out the candle he continued cathy and i escaped from the wash house to have a ramble at liberty and getting a glimpse of the grange lights we thought we would just go and see whether the lintons passed their sunday evenings standing shivering in corners while their father and mother sat eating and drinking and singing and laughing and burning their eyes out before the fire do you think they do or reading sermons and being catechised by their man servant and set to learn a column of scripture names if they dont answer properly probably not i responded they are good children no doubt and dont deserve the treatment you receive for your bad conduct dont cant nelly he said nonsense we ran from the top of the heights to the park without stopping catherine completely beaten in the race because she was barefoot youll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to morrow we crept through a broken hedge groped our way up the path and planted ourselves on a flower plot under the drawing room window the light came from thence they had not put up the shutters and the curtains were only half closed both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement and clinging to the ledge and we saw ah it was beautiful a splendid place carpeted with crimson and crimson covered chairs and tables and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold a shower of glass drops hanging in silver chains from the centre and shimmering with little soft tapers old mr and mrs linton were not there edgar and his sister had it entirely to themselves shouldnt they have been happy we should have thought ourselves in heaven and now guess what your good children were doing isabella i believe she is eleven a year younger than cathy lay screaming at the farther end of the room shrieking as if witches were running red hot needles into her edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently and in the middle of the table sat a little dog shaking its paw and yelping which from their mutual accusations we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them the idiots that was their pleasure to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair and each begin to cry because both after struggling to get it refused to take it we laughed outright at the petted things we did despise them when would you catch me wishing to have what catherine wanted or find us by ourselves seeking entertainment in yelling and sobbing and rolling on the ground divided by the whole room id not exchange for a thousand lives my condition here for edgar lintons at thrushcross grange not if i might have the privilege of flinging joseph off the highest gable and painting the house front with hindleys blood hush hush i interrupted still you have not told me heathcliff how catherine is left behind i told you we laughed he answered the lintons heard us and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door there was silence and then a cry oh mamma mamma oh papa oh mamma come here oh papa oh they really did howl out something in that way we made frightful noises to terrify them still more and then we dropped off the ledge because somebody was drawing the bars and we felt we had better flee i had cathy by the hand and was urging her on when all at once she fell down run heathcliff run she whispered they have let the bull dog loose and he holds me the devil had seized her ankle nelly i heard his abominable snorting she did not yell out no she would have scorned to do it if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow i did though i vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in christendom and i got a stone and thrust it between his jaws and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat a beast of a servant came up with a lantern at last shouting keep fast skulker keep fast he changed his note however when he saw skulkers game the dog was throttled off his huge purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver the man took cathy up she was sick not from fear im certain but from pain he carried her in i followed grumbling execrations and vengeance what prey robert hallooed linton from the entrance skulker has caught a little girl sir he replied and theres a lad here he added making a clutch at me who looks an out and outer very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep that they might murder us at their ease hold your tongue you foul mouthed thief you you shall go to the gallows for this mr linton sir dont lay by your gun no no robert said the old fool the rascals knew that yesterday was my rent day they thought to have me cleverly come in ill furnish them a reception there john fasten the chain give skulker some water jenny to beard a magistrate in his stronghold and on the sabbath too where will their insolence stop oh my dear mary look here dont be afraid it is but a boy yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once before he shows his nature in acts as well as features he pulled me under the chandelier and mrs linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror the cowardly children crept nearer also isabella lisping frightful thing put him in the cellar papa hes exactly like the son of the fortune teller that stole my tame pheasant isnt he edgar while they examined me cathy came round she heard the last speech and laughed edgar linton after an inquisitive stare collected sufficient wit to recognise her they see us at church you know though we seldom meet them elsewhere thats miss earnshaw he whispered to his mother and look how skulker has bitten her how her foot bleeds miss earnshaw nonsense cried the dame miss earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy and yet my dear the child is in mourning surely it is and she may be lamed for life what culpable carelessness in her brother exclaimed mr linton turning from me to catherine ive understood from shielders that was the curate sir that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism but who is this where did she pick up this companion oho i declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made in his journey to liverpool a little lascar or an american or spanish castaway a wicked boy at all events remarked the old lady and quite unfit for a decent house did you notice his language linton im shocked that my children should have heard it i recommenced cursing dont be angry nelly and so robert was ordered to take me off i refused to go without cathy he dragged me into the garden pushed the lantern into my hand assured me that mr earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour and bidding me march directly secured the door again the curtains were still looped up at one corner and i resumed my station as spy because if catherine had wished to return i intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments unless they let her out she sat on the sofa quietly mrs linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy maid which we had borrowed for our excursion shaking her head and expostulating with her i suppose she was a young lady and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine then the woman servant brought a basin of warm water and washed her feet and mr linton mixed a tumbler of negus and isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap and edgar stood gaping at a distance afterwards they dried and combed her beautiful hair and gave her a pair of enormous slippers and wheeled her to the fire and i left her as merry as she could be dividing her food between the little dog and skulker whose nose she pinched as he ate and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the lintons a dim reflection from her own enchanting face i saw they were full of stupid admiration she is so immeasurably superior to them to everybody on earth is she not nelly there will more come of this business than you reckon on i answered covering him up and extinguishing the light you are incurable heathcliff and mr hindley will have to proceed to extremities see if he wont my words came truer than i desired the luckless adventure made earnshaw furious and then mr linton to mend matters paid us a visit himself on the morrow and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family that he was stirred to look about him in earnest heathcliff received no flogging but he was told that the first word he spoke to miss catherine should ensure a dismissal and mrs earnshaw undertook to keep her sister in law in due restraint when she returned home employing art not force with force she would have found it impossible
