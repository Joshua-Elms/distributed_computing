to obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled mr linton commissioned me to take the boy home early on catherines pony and said he as we shall now have no influence over his destiny good or bad you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter she cannot associate with him hereafter and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity lest she should be restless and anxious to visit the heights merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly and he has been obliged to leave us linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five oclock and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling but i softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father mr heathcliff who wished to see him so much he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey my father he cried in strange perplexity mamma never told me i had a father where does he live id rather stay with uncle he lives a little distance from the grange i replied just beyond those hills not so far but you may walk over here when you get hearty and you should be glad to go home and to see him you must try to love him as you did your mother and then he will love you but why have i not heard of him before asked linton why didnt mamma and he live together as other people do he had business to keep him in the north i answered and your mothers health required her to reside in the south and why didnt mamma speak to me about him persevered the child she often talked of uncle and i learnt to love him long ago how am i to love papa i dont know him oh all children love their parents i said your mother perhaps thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you let us make haste an early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an hours more sleep is she to go with us he demanded the little girl i saw yesterday not now replied i is uncle he continued no i shall be your companion there i said linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study i wont go without uncle he cried at length i cant tell where you mean to take me i attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing and i had to call for my masters assistance in coaxing him out of bed the poor thing was finally got off with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short that mr edgar and cathy would visit him and other promises equally ill founded which i invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way the pure heather scented air the bright sunshine and the gentle canter of minny relieved his despondency after a while he began to put questions concerning his new home and its inhabitants with greater interest and liveliness is wuthering heights as pleasant a place as thrushcross grange he inquired turning to take a last glance into the valley whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue it is not so buried in trees i replied and it is not quite so large but you can see the country beautifully all round and the air is healthier for you fresher and drier you will perhaps think the building old and dark at first though it is a respectable house the next best in the neighbourhood and you will have such nice rambles on the moors hareton earnshaw that is miss cathys other cousin and so yours in a manner will show you all the sweetest spots and you can bring a book in fine weather and make a green hollow your study and now and then your uncle may join you in a walk he does frequently walk out on the hills and what is my father like he asked is he as young and handsome as uncle hes as young said i but he has black hair and eyes and looks sterner and he is taller and bigger altogether hell not seem to you so gentle and kind at first perhaps because it is not his way still mind you be frank and cordial with him and naturally hell be fonder of you than any uncle for you are his own black hair and eyes mused linton i cant fancy him then i am not like him am i not much i answered not a morsel i thought surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion and his large languid eyes his mothers eyes save that unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit how strange that he should never come to see mamma and me he murmured has he ever seen me if he has i must have been a baby i remember not a single thing about him why master linton said i three hundred miles is a great distance and ten years seem very different in length to a grown up person compared with what they do to you it is probable mr heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer but never found a convenient opportunity and now it is too late dont trouble him with questions on the subject it will disturb him for no good the boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride till we halted before the farmhouse garden gate i watched to catch his impressions in his countenance he surveyed the carved front and low browed lattices the straggling gooseberry bushes and crooked firs with solemn intentness and then shook his head his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode but he had sense to postpone complaining there might be compensation within before he dismounted i went and opened the door it was half past six the family had just finished breakfast the servant was clearing and wiping down the table joseph stood by his masters chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse and hareton was preparing for the hayfield hallo nelly said mr heathcliff when he saw me i feared i should have to come down and fetch my property myself youve brought it have you let us see what we can make of it he got up and strode to the door hareton and joseph followed in gaping curiosity poor linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three sure ly said joseph after a grave inspection hes swopped wi ye maister an yons his lass heathcliff having stared his son into an ague of confusion uttered a scornful laugh god what a beauty what a lovely charming thing he exclaimed havnt they reared it on snails and sour milk nelly oh damn my soul but thats worse than i expected and the devil knows i was not sanguine i bid the trembling and bewildered child get down and enter he did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his fathers speech or whether it were intended for him indeed he was not yet certain that the grim sneering stranger was his father but he clung to me with growing trepidation and on mr heathcliffs taking a seat and bidding him come hither he hid his face on my shoulder and wept tut tut said heathcliff stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees and then holding up his head by the chin none of that nonsense were not going to hurt thee linton isnt that thy name thou art thy mothers child entirely where is my share in thee puling chicken he took off the boys cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls felt his slender arms and his small fingers during which examination linton ceased crying and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector do you know me asked heathcliff having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble no said linton with a gaze of vacant fear youve heard of me i daresay no he replied again no what a shame of your mother never to waken your filial regard for me you are my son then ill tell you and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed now dont wince and colour up though it is something to see you have not white blood be a good lad and ill do for you nelly if you be tired you may sit down if not get home again i guess youll report what you hear and see to the cipher at the grange and this thing wont be settled while you linger about it well replied i i hope youll be kind to the boy mr heathcliff or youll not keep him long and hes all you have akin in the wide world that you will ever know remember ill be very kind to him you neednt fear he said laughing only nobody else must be kind to him im jealous of monopolising his affection and to begin my kindness joseph bring the lad some breakfast hareton you infernal calf begone to your work yes nell he added when they had departed my son is prospective owner of your place and i should not wish him to die till i was certain of being his successor besides hes mine and i want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates my child hiring their children to till their fathers lands for wages that is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp i despise him for himself and hate him for the memories he revives but that consideration is sufficient hes as safe with me and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own i have a room upstairs furnished for him in handsome style ive engaged a tutor also to come three times a week from twenty miles distance to teach him what he pleases to learn ive ordered hareton to obey him and in fact ive arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him above his associates i do regret however that he so little deserves the trouble if i wished any blessing in the world it was to find him a worthy object of pride and im bitterly disappointed with the whey faced whining wretch while he was speaking joseph returned bearing a basin of milk porridge and placed it before linton who stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion and affirmed he could not eat it i saw the old man servant shared largely in his masters scorn of the child though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart because heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour cannot ate it repeated he peering in lintons face and subduing his voice to a whisper for fear of being overheard but maister hareton nivir ate naught else when he wer a little un and what wer gooid eneugh for hims gooid eneugh for ye is rayther think i shant eat it answered linton snappishly take it away joseph snatched up the food indignantly and brought it to us is there aught ails th victuals he asked thrusting the tray under heathcliffs nose what should ail them he said wah answered joseph yon dainty chap says he cannut ate em but i guess its raight his mother wer just soa we wer amost too mucky to sow t corn for makking her breead dont mention his mother to me said the master angrily get him something that he can eat thats all what is his usual food nelly i suggested boiled milk or tea and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some come i reflected his fathers selfishness may contribute to his comfort he perceives his delicate constitution and the necessity of treating him tolerably ill console mr edgar by acquainting him with the turn heathcliffs humour has taken having no excuse for lingering longer i slipped out while linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep dog but he was too much on the alert to be cheated as i closed the door i heard a cry and a frantic repetition of the words dont leave me ill not stay here ill not stay here then the latch was raised and fell they did not suffer him to come forth i mounted minny and urged her to a trot and so my brief guardianship ended
