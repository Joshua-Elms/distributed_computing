a letter edged with black announced the day of my masters return isabella was dead and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter and arrange a room and other accommodations for his youthful nephew catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her real cousin the evening of their expected arrival came since early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs and now attired in her new black frock poor thing her aunts death impressed her with no definite sorrow she obliged me by constant worrying to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them linton is just six months younger than i am she chattered as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf under shadow of the trees how delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow aunt isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair it was lighter than mine more flaxen and quite as fine i have it carefully preserved in a little glass box and ive often thought what a pleasure it would be to see its owner oh i am happy and papa dear dear papa come ellen let us run come run she ran and returned and ran again many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path and tried to wait patiently but that was impossible she couldnt be still a minute how long they are she exclaimed ah i see some dust on the road they are coming no when will they be here may we not go a little way half a mile ellen only just half a mile do say yes to that clump of birches at the turn i refused staunchly at length her suspense was ended the travelling carriage rolled in sight miss cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her fathers face looking from the window he descended nearly as eager as herself and a considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves while they exchanged caresses i took a peep in to see after linton he was asleep in a corner wrapped in a warm fur lined cloak as if it had been winter a pale delicate effeminate boy who might have been taken for my masters younger brother so strong was the resemblance but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that edgar linton never had the latter saw me looking and having shaken hands advised me to close the door and leave him undisturbed for the journey had fatigued him cathy would fain have taken one glance but her father told her to come and they walked together up the park while i hastened before to prepare the servants now darling said mr linton addressing his daughter as they halted at the bottom of the front steps your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are and he has lost his mother remember a very short time since therefore dont expect him to play and run about with you directly and dont harass him much by talking let him be quiet this evening at least will you yes yes papa answered catherine but i do want to see him and he hasnt once looked out the carriage stopped and the sleeper being roused was lifted to the ground by his uncle this is your cousin cathy linton he said putting their little hands together shes fond of you already and mind you dont grieve her by crying to night try to be cheerful now the travelling is at an end and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please let me go to bed then answered the boy shrinking from catherines salute and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears come come theres a good child i whispered leading him in youll make her weep too see how sorry she is for you i do not know whether it was sorrow for him but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself and returned to her father all three entered and mounted to the library where tea was laid ready i proceeded to remove lintons cap and mantle and placed him on a chair by the table but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh my master inquired what was the matter i cant sit on a chair sobbed the boy go to the sofa then and ellen shall bring you some tea answered his uncle patiently he had been greatly tried during the journey i felt convinced by his fretful ailing charge linton slowly trailed himself off and lay down cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side at first she sat silent but that could not last she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin as she would have him to be and she commenced stroking his curls and kissing his cheek and offering him tea in her saucer like a baby this pleased him for he was not much better he dried his eyes and lightened into a faint smile oh hell do very well said the master to me after watching them a minute very well if we can keep him ellen the company of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon and by wishing for strength hell gain it ay if we can keep him i mused to myself and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that and then i thought how ever will that weakling live at wuthering heights between his father and hareton what playmates and instructors theyll be our doubts were presently decided even earlier than i expected i had just taken the children upstairs after tea was finished and seen linton asleep he would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case i had come down and was standing by the table in the hall lighting a bedroom candle for mr edgar when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that mr heathcliffs servant joseph was at the door and wished to speak with the master i shall ask him what he wants first i said in considerable trepidation a very unlikely hour to be troubling people and the instant they have returned from a long journey i dont think the master can see him joseph had advanced through the kitchen as i uttered these words and now presented himself in the hall he was donned in his sunday garments with his most sanctimonious and sourest face and holding his hat in one hand and his stick in the other he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat good evening joseph i said coldly what business brings you here to night its maister linton i mun spake to he answered waving me disdainfully aside mr linton is going to bed unless you have something particular to say im sure he wont hear it now i continued you had better sit down in there and entrust your message to me which is his rahm pursued the fellow surveying the range of closed doors i perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation so very reluctantly i went up to the library and announced the unseasonable visitor advising that he should be dismissed till next day mr linton had no time to empower me to do so for joseph mounted close at my heels and pushing into the apartment planted himself at the far side of the table with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick and began in an elevated tone as if anticipating opposition hathecliff has sent me for his lad and i munnt goa back bout him edgar linton was silent a minute an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features he would have pitied the child on his own account but recalling isabellas hopes and fears and anxious wishes for her son and her commendations of him to his care he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up and searched in his heart how it might be avoided no plan offered itself the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory there was nothing left but to resign him however he was not going to rouse him from his sleep tell mr heathcliff he answered calmly that his son shall come to wuthering heights to morrow he is in bed and too tired to go the distance now you may also tell him that the mother of linton desired him to remain under my guardianship and at present his health is very precarious noa said joseph giving a thud with his prop on the floor and assuming an authoritative air noa that means naught hathecliff maks noa count o t mother nor ye norther but hell hev his lad und i mun tak him soa now ye knaw you shall not to night answered linton decisively walk down stairs at once and repeat to your master what i have said ellen show him down go and aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm he rid the room of him and closed the door varrah weell shouted joseph as he slowly drew off to morn hes come hisseln and thrust him out if ye darr
