yesterday was bright calm and frosty i went to the heights as i proposed my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady and i did not refuse for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request the front door stood open but the jealous gate was fastened as at my last visit i knocked and invoked earnshaw from among the garden beds he unchained it and i entered the fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen i took particular notice of him this time but then he does his best apparently to make the least of his advantages i asked if mr heathcliff were at home he answered no but he would be in at dinner time it was eleven oclock and i announced my intention of going in and waiting for him at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me in the office of watchdog not as a substitute for the host we entered together catherine was there making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal she looked more sulky and less spirited than when i had seen her first she hardly raised her eyes to notice me and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before never returning my bow and good morning by the slightest acknowledgment she does not seem so amiable i thought as mrs dean would persuade me to believe shes a beauty it is true but not an angel earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen remove them yourself she said pushing them from her as soon as she had done and retiring to a stool by the window where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip parings in her lap i approached her pretending to desire a view of the garden and as i fancied adroitly dropped mrs deans note on to her knee unnoticed by hareton but she asked aloud what is that and chucked it off a letter from your old acquaintance the housekeeper at the grange i answered annoyed at her exposing my kind deed and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own she would gladly have gathered it up at this information but hareton beat her he seized and put it in his waistcoat saying mr heathcliff should look at it first thereat catherine silently turned her face from us and very stealthily drew out her pocket handkerchief and applied it to her eyes and her cousin after struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her as ungraciously as he could catherine caught and perused it eagerly then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates rational and irrational of her former home and gazing towards the hills murmured in soliloquy i should like to be riding minny down there i should like to be climbing up there oh im tired im stalled hareton and she leant her pretty head back against the sill with half a yawn and half a sigh and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her mrs heathcliff i said after sitting some time mute you are not aware that i am an acquaintance of yours so intimate that i think it strange you wont come and speak to me my housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you and shell be greatly disappointed if i return with no news of or from you except that you received her letter and said nothing she appeared to wonder at this speech and asked does ellen like you yes very well i replied hesitatingly you must tell her she continued that i would answer her letter but i have no materials for writing not even a book from which i might tear a leaf no books i exclaimed how do you contrive to live here without them if i may take the liberty to inquire though provided with a large library im frequently very dull at the grange take my books away and i should be desperate i was always reading when i had them said catherine and mr heathcliff never reads so he took it into his head to destroy my books i have not had a glimpse of one for weeks only once i searched through josephs store of theology to his great irritation and once hareton i came upon a secret stock in your room some latin and greek and some tales and poetry all old friends i brought the last here and you gathered them as a magpie gathers silver spoons for the mere love of stealing they are of no use to you or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that as you cannot enjoy them nobody else shall perhaps your envy counselled mr heathcliff to rob me of my treasures but ive most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart and you cannot deprive me of those earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations mr hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge i said coming to his rescue he is not envious but emulous of your attainments hell be a clever scholar in a few years and he wants me to sink into a dunce meantime answered catherine yes i hear him trying to spell and read to himself and pretty blunders he makes i wish you would repeat chevy chase as you did yesterday it was extremely funny i heard you and i heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words and then cursing because you couldnt read their explanations the young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance and then laughed at for trying to remove it i had a similar notion and remembering mrs deans anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared i observed but mrs heathcliff we have each had a commencement and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us we should stumble and totter yet oh she replied i dont wish to limit his acquirements still he has no right to appropriate what is mine and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations those books both prose and verse are consecrated to me by other associations and i hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth besides of all he has selected my favourite pieces that i love the most to repeat as if out of deliberate malice haretons chest heaved in silence a minute he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath which it was no easy task to suppress i rose and from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment took up my station in the doorway surveying the external prospect as i stood he followed my example and left the room but presently reappeared bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands which he threw into catherines lap exclaiming take them i never want to hear or read or think of them again i wont have them now she answered i shall connect them with you and hate them she opened one that had obviously been often turned over and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner then laughed and threw it from her and listen she continued provokingly commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion but his self love would endure no further torment i heard and not altogether disapprovingly a manual check given to her saucy tongue the little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousins sensitive though uncultivated feelings and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account and repaying its effects on the inflictor he afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire i read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen i fancied that as they consumed he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted and the triumph and ever increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them and i fancied i guessed the incitement to his secret studies also he had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments till catherine crossed his path shame at her scorn and hope of her approval were his first prompters to higher pursuits and instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the contrary result yes thats all the good that such a brute as you can get from them cried catherine sucking her damaged lip and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes youd better hold your tongue now he answered fiercely and his agitation precluded further speech he advanced hastily to the entrance where i made way for him to pass but ere he had crossed the door stones mr heathcliff coming up the causeway encountered him and laying hold of his shoulder asked whats to do now my lad naught naught he said and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude heathcliff gazed after him and sighed it will be odd if i thwart myself he muttered unconscious that i was behind him but when i look for his father in his face i find her every day more how the devil is he so like i can hardly bear to see him he bent his eyes to the ground and walked moodily in there was a restless anxious expression in his countenance i had never remarked there before and he looked sparer in person his daughter in law on perceiving him through the window immediately escaped to the kitchen so that i remained alone im glad to see you out of doors again mr lockwood he said in reply to my greeting from selfish motives partly i dont think i could readily supply your loss in this desolation ive wondered more than once what brought you here an idle whim i fear sir was my answer or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away i shall set out for london next week and i must give you warning that i feel no disposition to retain thrushcross grange beyond the twelve months i agreed to rent it i believe i shall not live there any more oh indeed youre tired of being banished from the world are you he said but if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you wont occupy your journey is useless i never relent in exacting my due from any one im coming to plead off nothing about it i exclaimed considerably irritated should you wish it ill settle with you now and i drew my note book from my pocket no no he replied coolly youll leave sufficient behind to cover your debts if you fail to return im not in such a hurry sit down and take your dinner with us a guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome catherine bring the things in where are you catherine reappeared bearing a tray of knives and forks you may get your dinner with joseph muttered heathcliff aside and remain in the kitchen till he is gone she obeyed his directions very punctually perhaps she had no temptation to transgress living among clowns and misanthropists she probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them with mr heathcliff grim and saturnine on the one hand and hareton absolutely dumb on the other i made a somewhat cheerless meal and bade adieu early i would have departed by the back way to get a last glimpse of catherine and annoy old joseph but hareton received orders to lead up my horse and my host himself escorted me to the door so i could not fulfil my wish how dreary life gets over in that house i reflected while riding down the road what a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for mrs linton heathcliff had she and i struck up an attachment as her good nurse desired and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town
