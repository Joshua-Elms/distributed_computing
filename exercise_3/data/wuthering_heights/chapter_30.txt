i have paid a visit to the heights but i have not seen her since she left joseph held the door in his hand when i called to ask after her and wouldnt let me pass he said mrs linton was thrang and the master was not in zillah has told me something of the way they go on otherwise i should hardly know who was dead and who living she thinks catherine haughty and does not like her i can guess by her talk my young lady asked some aid of her when she first came but mr heathcliff told her to follow her own business and let his daughter in law look after herself and zillah willingly acquiesced being a narrow minded selfish woman catherine evinced a childs annoyance at this neglect repaid it with contempt and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies as securely as if she had done her some great wrong i had a long talk with zillah about six weeks ago a little before you came one day when we foregathered on the moor and this is what she told me the first thing mrs linton did she said on her arrival at the heights was to run upstairs without even wishing good evening to me and joseph she shut herself into lintons room and remained till morning then while the master and earnshaw were at breakfast she entered the house and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent for her cousin was very ill we know that answered heathcliff but his life is not worth a farthing and i wont spend a farthing on him but i cannot tell how to do she said and if nobody will help me hell die walk out of the room cried the master and let me never hear a word more about him none here care what becomes of him if you do act the nurse if you do not lock him up and leave him then she began to bother me and i said id had enough plague with the tiresome thing we each had our tasks and hers was to wait on linton mr heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her how they managed together i cant tell i fancy he fretted a great deal and moaned hisseln night and day and she had precious little rest one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes she sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like and looked as if she would fain beg assistance but i was not going to disobey the master i never dare disobey him mrs dean and though i thought it wrong that kenneth should not be sent for it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain and i always refused to meddle once or twice after we had gone to bed ive happened to open my door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs top and then ive shut myself in quick for fear of being moved to interfere i did pity her then im sure still i didnt wish to lose my place you know at last one night she came boldly into my chamber and frightened me out of my wits by saying tell mr heathcliff that his son is dying im sure he is this time get up instantly and tell him having uttered this speech she vanished again i lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling nothing stirred the house was quiet shes mistaken i said to myself hes got over it i neednt disturb them and i began to doze but my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the bell the only bell we have put up on purpose for linton and the master called to me to see what was the matter and inform them that he wouldnt have that noise repeated i delivered catherines message he cursed to himself and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle and proceeded to their room i followed mrs heathcliff was seated by the bedside with her hands folded on her knees her father in law went up held the light to lintons face looked at him and touched him afterwards he turned to her now catherine he said how do you feel she was dumb how do you feel catherine he repeated hes safe and im free she answered i should feel well but she continued with a bitterness she couldnt conceal you have left me so long to struggle against death alone that i feel and see only death i feel like death and she looked like it too i gave her a little wine hareton and joseph who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet and heard our talk from outside now entered joseph was fain i believe of the lads removal hareton seemed a thought bothered though he was more taken up with staring at catherine than thinking of linton but the master bid him get off to bed again we didnt want his help he afterwards made joseph remove the body to his chamber and told me to return to mine and mrs heathcliff remained by herself in the morning he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast she had undressed and appeared going to sleep and said she was ill at which i hardly wondered i informed mr heathcliff and he replied well let her be till after the funeral and go up now and then to get her what is needful and as soon as she seems better tell me cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight according to zillah who visited her twice a day and would have been rather more friendly but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled heathcliff went up once to show her lintons will he had bequeathed the whole of his and what had been her moveable property to his father the poor creature was threatened or coaxed into that act during her weeks absence when his uncle died the lands being a minor he could not meddle with however mr heathcliff has claimed and kept them in his wifes right and his also i suppose legally at any rate catherine destitute of cash and friends cannot disturb his possession nobody said zillah ever approached her door except that once but i and nobody asked anything about her the first occasion of her coming down into the house was on a sunday afternoon she had cried out when i carried up her dinner that she couldnt bear any longer being in the cold and i told her the master was going to thrushcross grange and earnshaw and i neednt hinder her from descending so as soon as she heard heathcliffs horse trot off she made her appearance donned in black and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a quaker she couldnt comb them out joseph and i generally go to chapel on sundays the kirk you know has no minister now explained mrs dean and they call the methodists or baptists place i cant say which it is at gimmerton a chapel joseph had gone she continued but i thought proper to bide at home young folks are always the better for an elders over looking and hareton with all his bashfulness isnt a model of nice behaviour i let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us and she had been always used to see the sabbath respected so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone while she stayed he coloured up at the news and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes the train oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute i saw he meant to give her his company and i guessed by his way he wanted to be presentable so laughing as i durst not laugh when the master is by i offered to help him if he would and joked at his confusion he grew sullen and began to swear now mrs dean zillah went on seeing me not pleased by her manner you happen think your young lady too fine for mr hareton and happen youre right but i own i should love well to bring her pride a peg lower and what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her now shes as poor as you or i poorer ill be bound youre saving and im doing my little all that road hareton allowed zillah to give him her aid and she flattered him into a good humour so when catherine came half forgetting her former insults he tried to make himself agreeable by the housekeepers account missis walked in she said as chill as an icicle and as high as a princess i got up and offered her my seat in the arm chair no she turned up her nose at my civility earnshaw rose too and bid her come to the settle and sit close by the fire he was sure she was starved ive been starved a month and more she answered resting on the word as scornful as she could and she got a chair for herself and placed it at a distance from both of us having sat till she was warm she began to look round and discovered a number of books on the dresser she was instantly upon her feet again stretching to reach them but they were too high up her cousin after watching her endeavours a while at last summoned courage to help her she held her frock and he filled it with the first that came to hand that was a great advance for the lad she didnt thank him still he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance and ventured to stand behind as she examined them and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her instead of the book she continued reading or seeking for something to read his attention became by degrees quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls her face he couldnt see and she couldnt see him and perhaps not quite awake to what he did but attracted like a child to a candle at last he proceeded from staring to touching he put out his hand and stroked one curl as gently as if it were a bird he might have stuck a knife into her neck she started round in such a taking get away this moment how dare you touch me why are you stopping there she cried in a tone of disgust i cant endure you ill go upstairs again if you come near me mr hareton recoiled looking as foolish as he could do he sat down in the settle very quiet and she continued turning over her volumes another half hour finally earnshaw crossed over and whispered to me will you ask her to read to us zillah im stalled of doing naught and i do like i could like to hear her dunnot say i wanted it but ask of yourseln mr hareton wishes you would read to us maam i said immediately hed take it very kind hed be much obliged she frowned and looking up answered mr hareton and the whole set of you will be good enough to understand that i reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy to offer i despise you and will have nothing to say to any of you when i would have given my life for one kind word even to see one of your faces you all kept off but i wont complain to you im driven down here by the cold not either to amuse you or enjoy your society what could i ha done began earnshaw how was i to blame oh you are an exception answered mrs heathcliff i never missed such a concern as you but i offered more than once and asked he said kindling up at her pertness i asked mr heathcliff to let me wake for you be silent ill go out of doors or anywhere rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear said my lady hareton muttered she might go to hell for him and unslinging his gun restrained himself from his sunday occupations no longer he talked now freely enough and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude but the frost had set in and in spite of her pride she was forced to condescend to our company more and more however i took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature ever since ive been as stiff as herself and she has no lover or liker among us and she does not deserve one for let them say the least word to her and shell curl back without respect of any one shell snap at the master himself and as good as dares him to thrash her and the more hurt she gets the more venomous she grows at first on hearing this account from zillah i determined to leave my situation take a cottage and get catherine to come and live with me but mr heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up hareton in an independent house and i can see no remedy at present unless she could marry again and that scheme it does not come within my province to arrange * * * * * thus ended mrs deans story notwithstanding the doctors prophecy i am rapidly recovering strength and though it be only the second week in january i propose getting out on horseback in a day or two and riding over to wuthering heights to inform my landlord that i shall spend the next six months in london and if he likes he may look out for another tenant to take the place after october i would not pass another winter here for much
