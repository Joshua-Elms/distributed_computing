what vain weather cocks we are i who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse and thanked my stars that at length i had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable i weak wretch after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude was finally compelled to strike my colours and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment i desired mrs dean when she brought in supper to sit down while i ate it hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk you have lived here a considerable time i commenced did you not say sixteen years eighteen sir i came when the mistress was married to wait on her after she died the master retained me for his housekeeper indeed there ensued a pause she was not a gossip i feared unless about her own affairs and those could hardly interest me however having studied for an interval with a fist on either knee and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance she ejaculated ah times are greatly changed since then yes i remarked youve seen a good many alterations i suppose i have and troubles too she said oh ill turn the talk on my landlords family i thought to myself a good subject to start and that pretty girl widow i should like to know her history whether she be a native of the country or as is more probable an exotic that the surly indigenae will not recognise for kin with this intention i asked mrs dean why heathcliff let thrushcross grange and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order i inquired rich sir she returned he has nobody knows what money and every year it increases yes yes hes rich enough to live in a finer house than this but hes very near close handed and if he had meant to flit to thrushcross grange as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more it is strange people should be so greedy when they are alone in the world he had a son it seems yes he had one he is dead and that young lady mrs heathcliff is his widow yes where did she come from originally why sir she is my late masters daughter catherine linton was her maiden name i nursed her poor thing i did wish mr heathcliff would remove here and then we might have been together again what catherine linton i exclaimed astonished but a minutes reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly catherine then i continued my predecessors name was linton it was and who is that earnshaw hareton earnshaw who lives with mr heathcliff are they relations no he is the late mrs lintons nephew the young ladys cousin then yes and her husband was her cousin also one on the mothers the other on the fathers side heathcliff married mr lintons sister i see the house at wuthering heights has earnshaw carved over the front door are they an old family very old sir and hareton is the last of them as our miss cathy is of us i mean of the lintons have you been to wuthering heights i beg pardon for asking but i should like to hear how she is mrs heathcliff she looked very well and very handsome yet i think not very happy oh dear i dont wonder and how did you like the master a rough fellow rather mrs dean is not that his character rough as a saw edge and hard as whinstone the less you meddle with him the better he must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl do you know anything of his history its a cuckoos sir i know all about it except where he was born and who were his parents and how he got his money at first and hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock the unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated well mrs dean it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours i feel i shall not rest if i go to bed so be good enough to sit and chat an hour oh certainly sir ill just fetch a little sewing and then ill sit as long as you please but youve caught cold i saw you shivering and you must have some gruel to drive it out the worthy woman bustled off and i crouched nearer the fire my head felt hot and the rest of me chill moreover i was excited almost to a pitch of foolishness through my nerves and brain this caused me to feel not uncomfortable but rather fearful as i am still of serious effects from the incidents of to day and yesterday she returned presently bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work and having placed the former on the hob drew in her seat evidently pleased to find me so companionable * * * * * before i came to live here she commenced waiting no farther invitation to her story i was almost always at wuthering heights because my mother had nursed mr hindley earnshaw that was haretons father and i got used to playing with the children i ran errands too and helped to make hay and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to one fine summer morning it was the beginning of harvest i remember mr earnshaw the old master came downstairs dressed for a journey and after he had told joseph what was to be done during the day he turned to hindley and cathy and me for i sat eating my porridge with them and he said speaking to his son now my bonny man im going to liverpool to day what shall i bring you you may choose what you like only let it be little for i shall walk there and back sixty miles each way that is a long spell hindley named a fiddle and then he asked miss cathy she was hardly six years old but she could ride any horse in the stable and she chose a whip he did not forget me for he had a kind heart though he was rather severe sometimes he promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears and then he kissed his children said good bye and set off it seemed a long while to us all the three days of his absence and often did little cathy ask when he would be home mrs earnshaw expected him by supper time on the third evening and she put the meal off hour after hour there were no signs of his coming however and at last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look then it grew dark she would have had them to bed but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up and just about eleven oclock the door latch was raised quietly and in stepped the master he threw himself into a chair laughing and groaning and bid them all stand off for he was nearly killed he would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms and at the end of it to be flighted to death he said opening his great coat which he held bundled up in his arms see here wife i was never so beaten with anything in my life but you must een take it as a gift of god though its as dark almost as if it came from the devil we crowded round and over miss cathys head i had a peep at a dirty ragged black haired child big enough both to walk and talk indeed its face looked older than catherines yet when it was set on its feet it only stared round and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand i was frightened and mrs earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors she did fly up asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for what he meant to do with it and whether he were mad the master tried to explain the matter but he was really half dead with fatigue and all that i could make out amongst her scolding was a tale of his seeing it starving and houseless and as good as dumb in the streets of liverpool where he picked it up and inquired for its owner not a soul knew to whom it belonged he said and his money and time being both limited he thought it better to take it home with him at once than run into vain expenses there because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it well the conclusion was that my mistress grumbled herself calm and mr earnshaw told me to wash it and give it clean things and let it sleep with the children hindley and cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored then both began searching their fathers pockets for the presents he had promised them the former was a boy of fourteen but when he drew out what had been a fiddle crushed to morsels in the great coat he blubbered aloud and cathy when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing earning for her pains a sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manners they entirely refused to have it in bed with them or even in their room and i had no more sense so i put it on the landing of the stairs hoping it might be gone on the morrow by chance or else attracted by hearing his voice it crept to mr earnshaws door and there he found it on quitting his chamber inquiries were made as to how it got there i was obliged to confess and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house this was heathcliffs first introduction to the family on coming back a few days afterwards for i did not consider my banishment perpetual i found they had christened him heathcliff it was the name of a son who died in childhood and it has served him ever since both for christian and surname miss cathy and he were now very thick but hindley hated him and to say the truth i did the same and we plagued and went on with him shamefully for i wasnt reasonable enough to feel my injustice and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged he seemed a sullen patient child hardened perhaps to ill treatment he would stand hindleys blows without winking or shedding a tear and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes as if he had hurt himself by accident and nobody was to blame this endurance made old earnshaw furious when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child as he called him he took to heathcliff strangely believing all he said for that matter he said precious little and generally the truth and petting him up far above cathy who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite so from the very beginning he bred bad feeling in the house and at mrs earnshaws death which happened in less than two years after the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend and heathcliff as a usurper of his parents affections and his privileges and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries i sympathised a while but when the children fell ill of the measles and i had to tend them and take on me the cares of a woman at once i changed my idea heathcliff was dangerously sick and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow i suppose he felt i did a good deal for him and he hadnt wit to guess that i was compelled to do it however i will say this he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over the difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial cathy and her brother harassed me terribly he was as uncomplaining as a lamb though hardness not gentleness made him give little trouble he got through and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me and praised me for my care i was vain of his commendations and softened towards the being by whose means i earned them and thus hindley lost his last ally still i couldnt dote on heathcliff and i wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy who never to my recollection repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude he was not insolent to his benefactor he was simply insensible though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes as an instance i remember mr earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair and gave the lads each one heathcliff took the handsomest but it soon fell lame and when he discovered it he said to hindley you must exchange horses with me i dont like mine and if you wont i shall tell your father of the three thrashings youve given me this week and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder hindley put out his tongue and cuffed him over the ears youd better do it at once he persisted escaping to the porch they were in the stable you will have to and if i speak of these blows youll get them again with interest off dog cried hindley threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay throw it he replied standing still and then ill tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died and see whether he will not turn you out directly hindley threw it hitting him on the breast and down he fell but staggered up immediately breathless and white and had not i prevented it he would have gone just so to the master and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him intimating who had caused it take my colt gipsy then said young earnshaw and i pray that he may break your neck take him and be damned you beggarly interloper and wheedle my father out of all he has only afterwards show him what you are imp of satan and take that i hope hell kick out your brains heathcliff had gone to loose the beast and shift it to his own stall he was passing behind it when hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled ran away as fast as he could i was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up and went on with his intention exchanging saddles and all and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned before he entered the house i persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted he complained so seldom indeed of such stirs as these that i really thought him not vindictive i was deceived completely as you will hear
