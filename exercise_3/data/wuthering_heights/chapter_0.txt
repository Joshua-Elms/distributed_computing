1801 i have just returned from a visit to my landlord the solitary neighbour that i shall be troubled with this is certainly a beautiful country in all england i do not believe that i could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society a perfect misanthropists heaven and mr heathcliff and i are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us a capital fellow he little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when i beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as i rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still further in his waistcoat as i announced my name mr heathcliff i said a nod was the answer mr lockwood your new tenant sir i do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that i have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of thrushcross grange i heard yesterday you had had some thoughts thrushcross grange is my own sir he interrupted wincing i should not allow any one to inconvenience me if i could hinder it walk in the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words and i think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation i felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself when he saw my horses breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court joseph take mr lockwoods horse and bring up some wine here we have the whole establishment of domestics i suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order no wonder the grass grows up between the flags and cattle are the only hedge cutters joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy the lord help us he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that i charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent wuthering heights is the name of mr heathcliffs dwelling wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones before passing the threshold i paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys i detected the date 1500 and the name hareton earnshaw i would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and i had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium one step brought us into the family sitting room without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house pre eminently it includes kitchen and parlour generally but i believe at wuthering heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least i distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and i observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls one end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof the latter had never been under drawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horse pistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge the floor was of smooth white stone the chairs high backed primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade in an arch under the dresser reposed a huge liver coloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses the apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters such an individual seated in his arm chair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner but mr heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living he is a dark skinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of under bred pride i have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort i know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling to manifestations of mutual kindliness hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again no im running on too fast i bestow my own attributes over liberally on him mr heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would be acquaintance to those which actuate me let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say i should never have a comfortable home and only last summer i proved myself perfectly unworthy of one while enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast i was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me i never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed i was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a return the sweetest of all imaginable looks and what did i do i confess it with shame shrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and farther till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp by this curious turn of disposition i have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved i alone can appreciate i took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch my caress provoked a long guttural gnarl youd better let the dog alone growled mr heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot shes not accustomed to be spoiled not kept for a pet then striding to a side door he shouted again joseph joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me vis Ã  vis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep dogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements not anxious to come in contact with their fangs i sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults i unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees i flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us this proceeding aroused the whole hive half a dozen four footed fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre i felt my heels and coat laps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as i could with the poker i was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in re establishing peace mr heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm i dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tucked up gown bare arms and fire flushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a frying pan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene what the devil is the matter he asked eyeing me in a manner that i could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment what the devil indeed i muttered the herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours sir you might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers they wont meddle with persons who touch nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table the dogs do right to be vigilant take a glass of wine no thank you not bitten are you if i had been i would have set my signet on the biter heathcliffs countenance relaxed into a grin come come he said you are flurried mr lockwood here take a little wine guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that i and my dogs i am willing to own hardly know how to receive them your health sir i bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides i felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since his humour took that turn he probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant relaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement i found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before i went home i was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to morrow he evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion i shall go notwithstanding it is astonishing how sociable i feel myself compared with him
